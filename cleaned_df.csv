Meditation,Massive announcement concerning the future of the human species of this planet! Please listen and see for yourself later when I post more. Namaste. Love. Peace. Goodwill. The time is now!,"Now that I have burned all the past karma that has been weighing on me for approximately 3 years I have to say something, I am not Maitreya but his master, and I am in training for the role of the World Teachers' human surrogate where in that role I will be essentially the spiritual guide from the resources of the human kingdom in a primary sense, because I possess all forms of God expression within the soul that I am.  When you realize based on my writings here on reddit that what I say is true then you will know a big step that is necessary for you to take so that you can encourage yourself to improve for the sake of benefiting others socially economically and spiritually, because that is what is important.  The Maitreya that I refer to is the one from the writings of Benjamin Creme, a man who has since gone away but will return in a new body and mind with the same skillset and will inform the millions of people who are willing to receive his information which I will also assist in.  Before I go further, I will need to mention that this writing is primarily drawn from the intuition of me, or the soul operating the vehicle called Jared Maxwell Moran, in which there is a great deal of potential in the personality named Jared Maxwell Moran.  If you want to know more about my responsibilities and how you can better yourself I am fast at work as soon after I finish writing this post I will be writing a book which will be approximately 200 pages in length and it will essentially be a manifesto of all the things that need to be done, and explicitly with my help.  There is no real alternative as I am the most advanced person on this planet in the limited human experience primarily so indeed I will need to prepare, but in the mean time I will have to write through the wisdom and input of Maitreya the World Teacher and my disciple where he can do more than me at the present time until this form known as Jared Maxwell Moran is reduced to ashes.  When the time comes for the book to be published, I will have prepared for a year under the careful and incredibly helpful watch of Maitreya, the Masters at his side, and the space brothers of our little solar system which have been assisting me since the day I was born to keep me alive and well.  Without me, I am afraid, this planet could be completely lost from the selfishness and greed of those with power and influence, including the people of the general public as well, which I say with cold objectivity and no emotional hatred or animosity towards the greed or the people who express it.  Please understand that this post is written by Maitreya through the fingers of this body and I will tell you right now this inspired writing is the absolute truth, and the truth must be known, for I am the most advanced human being in the solar system outside of Gods from the etheric plane that corresponds with the dense physical planet of Venus.  There is a short amount of time before the climate crises reaches a boiling point, about 50 years from now before the world is reduced to a mad max landscape where drought and destitution of people who have average current resource amounts will continue until the Masters of Wisdom will have to abandon the world entirely due to a certainty of no receptivity in the future.  I will continue to do the work laid out before me until I recognize a world that is on track, at which point I will have to perish from the Earth form known as Jared and subsume more energy and ability and succeed Maitreya after a 2500 year period of growth under the primary attention and ability of Maitreya and his disciples, who are under me.  When the climate crisis is solved and I have a firm understanding that the world has been saved from the dysfunction of greed and selfishness, until then I will be your human representative of the Hierarchy and its plan of evolution for the lower level gods of this earth, namely you and the rest of the whole people of this planet.  That is all.  Peace.  Love.  Help others.  Service is God.  Express who you really are, service to others itself.  That is why we are here.  Do one-no matter how small- act of service every day and God will take care of you and your family.

Meditation,Meditation Technique to deal with the first minutes with a noisy mind,"I have been meditating for 220 consecutive days today. I usually follow my breath, but in times of first world struggles such as stress, sickness or other thought spamming conditions I always found the first 10 minutes unpleasant and demanding to get through. There is a lot of “turbulence” some days before I get to the “cruise altitude”.


Recently I came up with a method by a lot of trial and error which works really well for me. I want to share that in the hope others might find it useful. It is meant as a way to quite your mind to get to a more pleasant state of the meditation comfortably.


The method consists of two parts:

1) when inhaling, focus on peripheral awareness. It feels like we have a “muscle” we can easily activate for peripheral senses. Recall how it feels when someone is standing behind you, maybe in the line in the supermarket. Try recalling how you once in a while “scan” the ones behind you without turning around and looking at them. That is the “muscle” which should be activated when inhaling. If you are more into the visual sense you can also recall how it is to look at a spot in the wall and then put your attention to everything else than the dot you are focusing on. It’s the same “muscle” for peripheral awareness to activate when inhaling.


2) when exhaling, focus on attention. Simply just put all you have into the sensation of exhaling. Ideally keep a strong focus at the point around your nostrils where the breath leaves the body.


Mix in your surroundings, such as sounds etc when inhaling. It’s a good opportunity to stay mental aware. Let it go when exhaling and fall back to the strong focus.


The peripheral “muscle” is something you might want to work on and customize to your personal liking.


Wish you a peaceful meditation.",True,0,1640903751,2021-12-31 06:35:51,,,hartmanners,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/rse96q/meditation_technique_to_deal_with_the_first/,1,1.0,technique deal first minute noisy mind 220 consecutive day today usually follow breath time first world struggle stress sickness think spamming condition always find first 10 minute unpleasant demand lot turbulence day cruise altitude recently come method lot trial error work really well want share hope others might find useful mean way quite mind pleasant state comfortably method consist two part 1 inhale focus peripheral awareness feel muscle easily activate peripheral sense recall feel someone stand behind maybe line supermarket try recall scan one behind without turn around look muscle activate inhale visual sense recall look spot wall put attention everything dot focus muscle peripheral awareness activate inhale 2 exhale focus attention simply put sensation exhale ideally keep strong focus point around nostril breath leave body mix surround sound etc inhale good opportunity stay mental aware let go exhale fall back strong focus peripheral muscle something might want work customize personal wish peaceful,155,30,0,2,6
Meditation,What should I focus on if I’m meditating without a video guide?,"I’ve tried to make meditation a part of my daily habit for a while now but it never sticks.

Meditation,Noticing a Difference,"I happened to make a commitment this month to meditate every weekday before my mind-numbing day job, 20 min right after I wake up.

Although keeping a daily routine wasn't perfect, I'm finally aware of what happens if I don't meditate.

If I don't meditate - like today when I overslept - the paranoia slithers back into my overactive imagination. The kind of self-harming paranoia that cripples any sense of motivation, drive, and confidence I had. I can't determine if I felt differently when I meditated before work pre-Pandemic, time was really limited with waking up, getting ready, and commuting an hour to the office. I still do the same amount of work with or without meditating, but the mind races to the absolute worse possible scenarios on my life. Dark stuff. After work, it's just recovery mode. Can't write, can't job search, can't eat a healthy meal, just... recovering. Meditating after work doesn't reset me. I have to sleep.

And it always happens with this day job.

Now when I don't meditate on a day job day, I'm fine. I can go on with my day without a problem.

It's one step figuring out my brain in my mid-30s, but it's a meaningful step for me.

Meditation,"The constant need to theorise, plan and assess","Ever since I can remember I've always had an incessant need to plan and theorise about most things I do in life. This was made even more intense when I got into self improvement. Now I plan everything, constantly theorise about why this or that went wrong, how to improve etc. It does drive me a bit mad but at the same time I've always saw it as necessary. If I'm ever struggling with an idea, or how to proceed in a certain aspect of life I'll just think on it for a while, or go for a walk, work through it and usually come up with an answer. One of the challenges I've had over the last year or so is recognising when the planning is getting in the way of action, and pushing past that need to think rather than do.

So recently I've started going deeper into the mindfulness and meditation practice. I've been doing it almost passively for a few years now, but not for long periods of time. I was also until recently under the false impression that meditation was all about clearing the mind, no thoughts occurring whatsoever. It seems that I've come to the realisation (probably from this sub) that I've been fighting my mind everytime I try to self improvement, to resist temptation, or to clear the mind of thoughts. Instead of just letting the mind do what it does and not reacting to it, I've been fighting against it constantly trying to rein it in, to bring it under my control. Ever since this realisation I've switched from seeing meditation as something to do in the mornings and evenings, but actually trying to remain mindful all day whenever I notice that I'm lost in the clouds.

Meditation,Advice on mindfulness - being distracted,"Hi all - I hope you're having a great day. 

I've got a question on mindfulness and needing distraction I'm hoping you can help with. 

So a few years ago I started meditating, at the time I would also practice mindfulness and I've honestly never felt better. But slowly I meditated less and less, became more disconnected from the moment until now. Where over the last couple of months I've noticed that I require constant distraction, most typically my phone. But even if I'm watching a movie or playing video games, I need a secondary source of entertainment In the background. Such as playing video games with a TV show in the background. Or watching a movie while on my phone. 

I find it impossible to think I used to be able to walk around town without headphones, just existing with a relatively clear mind, but I did. 

I've recently started to try and wind down on these forms of entertainment but I'm curious if anyone has gone through something similar and would be able to give me advice on (a) cutting down on the amount of distraction I need (b) bringing mindfulness into my life.

Any thoughts would be very welcome.

to me after meditation is a state I'm familiar with- no thoughts, and hyperawareness of reality. I'm in this state all the time when I wake up and have had almost no sleep.

Meditation,Contradictions in Meditation,"I've always heard that meditating with a goal defeats or purpose the point of meditation. What does that even mean? Why would I meditate if I have no goal in mind? There doesn't have to be a finish line, my goal could simply be ""to feel more content in life"", ""to gain better control over my emotions"", ""to help cope with mental disorders"", etc, but supposedly having these goals defeats the point of meditation? So why meditate? Just because you feel like it? I have ADHD, never in my life have I ever just *felt* like sitting still for 10 minutes and quieting my thoughts. Yet I can't say, the benefits from meditation are very real and I meditate with the goal of receiving these benefits. So am I defeating the point of meditation?

And then here's the other contradiction I don't understand. In meditation you're suppose to just let your thoughts come and go. You're not supposed to influence them, just observe them. Watch them. The best way to clear muddy water is to not mess with it. Y'know, except for when you *notice* that your thoughts have wondered, in which case now you're *suppose* to take control of your thoughts and bring your attention back to whatever your object of focus is (typically the breath). One moment I suppose to just watch my thoughts and then the next I'm not?

I just don't get it. I like concrete rules to follow, and maybe that's my downfall here. But the ""rules"" seem so wishy washy, and I already feel like someone's gonna say ""there are no rules and there is not right or wrong way to meditate"", but there has to be ""rules"", and there has to be a ""wrong"" way.

Meditation,Head falls over,"hello :) I have been practicing mindfullness for around 5 years now, recently my girlfriend and I started meditating together.

She is not falling asleep. She says that she knows what falling a sleep is like. She describes it more like ""going into a void"".

I asked if she wanted to try meditating lying down, but she said that she felt like it would be better to do it sitting, because then she ""can better feel how far she is able to go into the void"".

Meditation,I have a hard time consciously belly breathing… it’s like I physically can’t belly breathe.. unless I’m waking up from a sleep..,"So I’ve noticed that, when I’m waking up from sleep, just laying there not yet getting up, but somewhat conscious, that my breathing is solely belly breathing, diaphragm breathing, and so effortlessly. 

But when I’m awake and I go to meditate (belly breathing), I find it extremely difficult to belly breathe. Like I definitely have to mentally think about breathing through my belly, and even then it feels like I’m not even doing it correctly. Like, I really have to force it, and even then it’s like I can’t belly breathe, I chest breathe.

Maybe it’s my general anxiety (I’m always aware of my heartbeat and it speeds up very often), that makes me a chest breather, but still I find it extremely difficult to belly breathe.

I’m also semi-convinced that I can’t belly breathe “on command” because I overthink the belly-breathe aspect of it, so when I try to push my stomach out as I’m inhaling, me being thin/underweight, it’s like I can’t push out my stomach anymore to inhale. 

The only thing I’ve noticed is that belly breathing is a bit easier if my bad is slightly raised, like if  I’m sitting/laying at a 45 ° angle. It somehow limits my chest breathing.

Meditation,Breathless state meditation (my insane experience),"Recently I experienced breathless state meditation, the thing is i never knew there's such a deep state in. meditation.
If anyone doesn't know what breathless state is, it's a very deep state in meditation where your body metabolism is soooo slow that your breath is almost none since its not required that much, and your heartbeat is slowed down to an insane level. this state is how yogis meditate for days. 

back to my experience story, as i said, i didn't know there's such depth levels to meditation,
the first thing i recognized was my mind went entirely silent, like my mind completely went mute, and there was an insane feeling of peace/bliss/happiness, as if the worries of my mind has disappeared entirely.
second, i completely lost my sense of body, I didn't know where my boundary of body was, i kept expanding and expanding.
third, i recognized i am not breathing and strangely i didn't feel like breathing, it was as if i don't need to breathe anymore, it was at this moment i panicked, since I didn't know about this state, i thought i was dying and my mind came back and i was desperately trying to make sense where my eyes were, it took a while to feel my eyes and i finally opened them and i realized i am still in my body. Since i understood i was not dead, i kept on meditating, my sense of body was still vague, but i kept feeling different and i was meditating without any bother from my body.


this happened two days ago, and I learned about such a state from Google later on, i am so excited that i was able to reach such a state, and listen to this part, i have been meditating seriously only for a few weeks!. the articles i read kept saying it was something advanced which takes a lot of years. I think it's about self analyzing a lot and understand what the mind is doing to you that will lead to better meditative practices. 


since that happened, i have been feeling a lot more aware and separate from mind, it feels like there's a pleasantness in everything and i feel more open. i am not sure how to describe it.

i haven't had that breathless state experience again, but my further meditations have been much easier and loss of body sensation is recurring too.
i was so hung up on that experience the first day, i shouldn't be hung up, it's like my ego is blocking myself. but I am getting better at controlling my ego now. hopefully i will such an experience again and i will be better prepared for it.

Meditation,How i recently started,"In August I smoked my last cigarette after 12 years of addiction. During withdrawal i realised cigarettes had been the only one coping mechanism on me despite occasional screaming into the pillow and i needed something else. Later that month thanks to YouTube algorithm i came across videos about diaphragmatic breathing and learnt how to do it.  When i had a strong urge to smoke i switched my focus on lower rib movement while taking deep breaths, it was really helpful to say the least. 

Months passed but new healthy habit stayed with me and i wanted to learn more about breathing. In October i read ""The Breathing Cure"" by Patrick McKeown. The main exercise given there is to breath lightly and softly through your nose with 4 second inhale/ 6 second exhale (i use metronome on my phone and don't count anymore) using lower ring expansion for 4 minutes. Since then i have been doing it everyday everywhere i could multiple times a day gradually increasing time because my body asked for it. I went from 4 minutes per session to 15 realising that my breath work is also a meditation since wondering mind needs constant focus redirection on breathing and feeling of relaxation. 

I am amazed how i didn't get it earlier but may be it's for the better. Time increasement led to unexpected side effects like occasional muscle tweaking during some sessions, insomnia if i meditate right before bed, emotional overflow afterwards followed by a loud scream into a pillow. Now i understand how powerful this tool is and stopped meditating right before sleep at least for now. 

Needed to get this off my chest and share with people who can relate. I plan on getting better at it by gradually increasing time, reducing breaths per minute and maybe later even freeing myself from metronome leash.",True,0,1640731671,2021-12-29 06:47:51,,,moskosmash,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/rqrydr/how_i_recently_started/,1,1.0,recently start august smoke last cigarette 12 year addiction withdrawal realise cigarette one cop mechanism despite occasional scream pillow need something later month thank youtube algorithm come across video diaphragmatic breathe learn strong urge smoke switch focus lower rib movement take deep breath really helpful say least month pas new healthy habit stay want learn breathe october read breathe cure patrick mckeown main exercise give breath lightly softly nose 4 second inhale 6 second exhale use metronome phone count anymore use lower ring expansion 4 minute everyday everywhere multiple time day gradually increase time body ask go 4 minute per session 15 realise breath work wonder mind need constant focus redirection breathe feel relaxation amaze didnt earlier may better time increasement lead unexpected side effect occasional muscle tweak session insomnia right bed emotional overflow afterwards follow loud scream pillow understand powerful tool stop right sleep least need chest share people relate plan better gradually increase time reduce breath per minute maybe later even free metronome leash,126,26,0,6,4

Meditation,Clarification needed,"On the path of practicing meditation, I want to incorporate more mindfulness. However, I was reading a book that talked about concentration meditation (focusing on the breath, noticing thoughts and returning to the breath, what I do.) not being the way to having realizations and changes in perception  through meditation, but mindfulness must be incorporated into this. So I guess, I’m confused as to how to incorporate mindfulness into my meditation, and honestly, what mindfulness really is. Sorry if that’s a huge question, I’m just needing some guidance on this.

I am not annoyed. BEING annoyed does not need to define me in the present moment. For the next minute while driving I felt the physical sensations that followed that initial thought. I felt the tightness in my body, noticing, feeling. Feeling that **being** annoyed is just a thought. I was able to take a step back. I let myself feel, think, hear and see, without judgment.

I'd be especially interested in hearing from anyone who has experienced this issue and overcome it. I'm feeling discouraged at the moment as reconciling my body and mind is feeling like an impossible task; I would love to know that it is possible and that there is hope that I could feel okay.

Meditation,How to get into mediation…as a teen who always thought it was lame?,"I’m a teenager who’s looking to be more spiritual and more self-reflecting. Until recently, I really had the “fuck taking care of yourself” mentality. I realized that I was comparing myself to other people that had a better things than I did, trying to be someone I wasn’t, etc etc and I want to get out of it, and recently deleted all identifying social media as a detox

now as a teenage outcast punk/hippie who doesn’t have friends to sell me psychoactive drugs or anything, I’ve decided to come here for some guidance…I have never tried meditation because I always blew it off as a waste of time, but now I’m realizing it’s probably the most healthy outlet to discover myself in. if anyone has some good tips for me to start somewhere.

Meditation,An.... Uhh.... Interesting experience 😂,"I had an experience that I have not put much thought into, but today as I was meditating the memory came back (this experience happened about a month ago) and an urge to share my experience bubbled up.

Basically what happened is this. I used to be very very busy and would often go into work with zero hours of sleep and a lot of caffeine, every Monday guaranteed. This was one of those days. I was extremely exhausted physically but focused mentally. I was getting stressed out over nothing, as one with zero hours of sleep does, and was craving a nap. I took my lunch break and napped for ten minutes. I woke up drowsy and caffeinated still and decided meditation would help. It started off rough. My stress and thoughts were fighting for control, or rather I was struggling to let go and embrace them.

Finally after about ten minutes I managed to let go and my thoughts came in like a tsunami (since mindfulness meditation isn't about not thinking, it's about not associating with thought). Thoughts were going crazy but it felt really good. At first it just tickled my soul if that makes sense. Just the act of having thoughts made me giggly, angry thoughts or not. Then it started feeling REALLY good. It felt like the peak of a sexual orgasm except it just wouldn't stop. I wish I was making this up 😂. The thoughts felt like they were planned out, like it was just time taking it's course exactly like it was supposed to. It was very intense but very peaceful and well, orgasmic. Imagine a literal orgasm as being a line rather than a peak. Just the act of having thoughts felt better than any sexual orgasm could ever feel.

This sounds like drugs ik, but I am sober. I've smoked weed a few times in my teenage years and done shrooms twice (long before this experience and both were low doses).

Meditation,Beginner question,"I’m practicing mindfulness and I’m wondering if I’m doing something wrong. Should I be trying to reach a different state of consciousness (becoming more aware of things), or is the point to just catch yourself when your mind wanders? I’m asking because I’ve tried 2 different techniques:

1. I was looking at different objects around me, focused on each one and tried to become more aware of it by savoring it for about 10 seconds. I was doing this for 20 minutes, and during the meditation, I noticed a shift in my conscious state, I became really aware of the things that surround me, I don’t know how to explain it, you probably get it.

2. The 2nd technique involves me being focused on my breath, and catching my thoughts when they wander. This practice doesn’t get me to the same state of awareness, which is why I’m wondering if I’m doing something wrong. It feels like I’m training focus rather than meditating. Maybe it’s just me, but I can’t seem to reach this heightened sense of awareness if I’m trying to focus on my breath. 

I’m thinking to redesign my process, by starting with the focus on my breath at the beginning, then redirect my attention to my body (feel my legs touching, back pressing on the wall, my fingers…), then focus on my surroundings and become aware of it, either in my imagination or by opening my eyes, then finish with focus on my breath again. Does this seem wise for my case?

To sum up, to me, focusing on my breath and catching my mind when it wanders feels like a focus exercise, pushing me away from the state I think I should be striving for when meditating.",True,0,1640651956,2021-12-28 08:39:16,,,UndefinedSpaceVoid,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/rq1yvx/beginner_question/,1,1.0,beginner question practice mindfulness wonder something wrong try reach different state consciousness become aware thing point catch mind wander ask try 2 different technique 1 look different object around focus one try become aware savor 10 second 20 minute notice shift conscious state become really aware thing surround know explain probably 2 2nd technique involve focus breath catch thought wander practice doesnt state awareness wonder something wrong feel train focus rather maybe seem reach heighten sense awareness try focus breath think redesign process start focus breath begin redirect attention body feel leg touch back press wall finger focus surround become aware either imagination open eye finish focus breath seem wise case sum focus breath catch mind wander feel focus exercise push away state think strive,128,38,0,3,9

Meditation,Emotional Christmas,"I wanted start off by saying meditation has been a life changer for me. I have been practicing a little over a year now and I want to continue to strengthen my patience and inner peace. But this Christmas really tested my patience. Not Christmas in general but my family. 

Being home with my sisters has really taken a strain in my emotions and energy. I have two loud, extroverted, and nosy sisters with opposite views than myself. 

Before they came over I Meditated and I told myself I will not get worked up and bicker with my sisters.  I failed almost immediately. Without getting into to much details, my older sister comes in with a controlling attitude. Bossing me around and making me feel like I'm her child. My face says it all and my mom will go on my sister side and tell me how we need to start acting more loving towards each other.  Then I refuse to take pictures for Christmas. I tell my sister that I refuse to be part of her lie on social media, we are not the brady bunch and I don't want to pretend to be like them. She tells me I am bitter. Idk. maybe I am. 

This type of bickering goes on for a couple of days. And at the end I am left feeling completely drained and feeling like I was the Grinch this Christmas. Even as I try to remember my practice, I just cant pretend to be joyful around my family. I guess I have some inner work to do to figure out why I get so triggered with my family but I just wanted a place to vent my frustration.  I want to change. I don't want to be the stick in the mud and make family gathering uncomfortable. I just don't know where to start.

When inner pain seems unbearable, be still. When you've given up on others, be still. When you've given up on yourself, be still and when you've given up on everything, be still.....  


For as night follows day, the passing of moment to moment brings in new souls, new learnings and new understandings. Sometimes – just sometimes – it's as simple as just not reacting, and merely accepting any given test or challenge that heals these moments. Sometimes – just sometimes – the answers lie in our stillness.   


In the end, everything passes us by and looking back, it will surely always be your strength in NOT reacting that shows you your measuring stick to pass any of your given tests – as well as revealing your own inner strength.  


So today, begin a new journey – one that allows healing into your life, less stress and more understanding. From today, say no to knee-jerking in response to any issues; if anything stops you from moving forward, simply look up and say ‘Thank you.’ In the end you will come to see that everything and everyone that touches your life – and everything and everyone that leaves your life – was exactly as it was supposed to be. Trust that no matter what happens, and no matter how hard it may seem, there is always always a bigger picture that sometimes can only be understood when we move into our Spirit World. Until that moment arrives, let us all just trust that whatever happens from today is never anything personal or karmic – or bad luck. Remember, dear friends, the bigger the challenges the stronger we truly are.   


Now be still, dear friends, because you are amazing and amazing people have no need to fear or be angry. You know that it's just a waste of energy and in the end, your peace and happiness are far more important in your life.  


Be happy today and let no one become so important that they ever take away the happiness you spread to others each and every day. Your smile heals this world.

Meditation,"Mental noting while talking, reading, or writing","Hi guys. I'm following Mahasi Sayadaw's mental noting technique, finding that it's quite useful for me. However, I also find it's hard to keep mental noting when I am talking, reading, or writing something.

It's difficult to (mentally) speak two different things (one for, say, reading the words on a book, one for mental noting ""reading, reading"") at the same time. In fact, this is just how mental noting works! As [Nyanaponika Thera mentioned](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nyanaponika/wheel121.html#ch1.1):

&gt;The working principle here is the simple fact that two thoughts cannot coexist at the same time: if the clear light of mindfulness is present, there is no room for mental twilight.

So, I feel confused by this seemingly paradoxical fact. Any insight would be greatly helpful.

Meditation,The power of mantras,"I found a self help book in my moms office when I was in college. It was called “how to talk to yourself”. I never read it. Only read the preface where it compared the mind to our muscles. It said, we need repetitions in the gym to maintain and build muscle and we need to do the same with our mind. Repeat affirmations enough and your mind will accept them as truths whether or not it is so. From that day forward I introduced mantras into my meditation practice. I’ve been consistently meditating for +8 years. After I find stillness and calm, usually 10 minutes in, I will say my mantras. I believe in this state our brain is more receptive to these affirmations. I have 6 mantras I say but the one that I’ve been saying the longest is “I trust the process, I do not worry about things that are outside my control”. Point being is that I really do live that philosophy now. When I was younger I was a bit neurotic and often anxious. As an adult I’m extremely go with the flow and people often compliment how chill I am. They often assume that it’s just my personality and I guess it is NOW but it took years of reprogramming.

Meditation,The MIDL Meditation system,"I am sharing here a subreddit for the MIDL system: r/midlmeditation

If you are new to the system, here as an introduction:

MIDL offers you a systematic way of bringing the benefits of mindfulness meditation into your daily life. MIDL is a Buddhist Satipatthana Vipassana practice based on the discourse called the Satipatthana Sutta given by the Buddha over 2600 years ago. The MIDL meditator seeks to find the middle path within mindfulness meditation practice, by neither suppressing or avoiding any experience but rather by softening into and unifying within the experience itself. This path leads to the softening of attraction and aversion towards pleasant and unpleasant feeling and a seamless integration of meditation into daily life.

If you want to learn more about the MIDL system or are already practicing it, you are welcome to join this community.

Meditation,"Thoughts are like the hasty winds surrounding what is the eye of the storm, a single point which never moves despite being surrounded by chaos, and that is consciousness","This point is consciousness. What you’re meant to realize with meditation is the limits of thought itself. Outside of a meditation practice, think that a good idea or a bad idea is nothing but a crazy complex story surrounding something which can’t be described, therefore it is many times pointless. This single point is the present. Whenever you find yourself overthinking, anxious and worried, try to be conscious of how your mind naturally comes up with new solutions to the problem on its own.

Meditation,"Maybe meditation could Help, but I feel like I have to do more to get my clear mind back","When I was a kid, I had the most amazing imagination. However, I never really knew it was so good until I had lost it.

I was a very lonely, introspective, shy, and awkward kid. I spent years in elementary school without a single person my age to call a friend (at least at school). Most of the time, I felt like my life was kind-of stuck and sad. Existing in reality as I knew it was an overall undesirable experience, and I preferred to be anywhere or anyone else most of the time. The loneliness was depressing and sometimes overwhelming.

For quite a long time, my absolute favorite thing to do was sit in a corner and imagine different scenarios. Sometimes, leaning my head on the window of the bus on my way home from school, I would picture myself as a winged, beautiful person, soaring away from the school and all of the mean people. Flying away and living in the mountains, dancing in the flower-filled meadows that sprung up in the middle of dense, enchanted forests, and sitting with a good book by a sparkling stream. I had a similar dream once and thought about it often.

Sometimes it would be in the late hours of night, after everyone else had gone to sleep and I couldn't. I would sit in my dark room and stare up at the ceiling or close my eyes, cuddled up to my favorite stuffed bear. My mind would take me to a castle or a cabin or a forest, and there I would be with someone I loved, someone who loved me. That was my absolute favorite thing to imagine; That I was loved. That I wasn't completely and totally alone.

Sure, I have family. I have a sister and two parents. I have cousins and grandparents and aunts and uncles, and now I have some friends too. But, for some reason, I've spent almost 100% of my life feeling like every single person I have ever known never really *knew* me, or even cared about me. I feel like I've hardly ever been able to show anyone my true self. I know it's a part of *me* that does it, and it's something I have to fix, but it feels impossible sometimes.

My imagination was my safe house. It was the only place where I could feel like my life actually had meaning. Sometimes it was the only place I truly felt happy or at ease. It was my escape. That's how powerful my imaginative capabilities were.

Over the years, as I've started using technology more (particularly YouTube), I feel like my mind becomes more and more clouded. One day, near the end of my eighth grade year, I realized that I couldn't visualize anymore. It was like a fog had moved into my brain and made it impossible to see clearly. *Everything* was foggy. I realized this when I tried to read a new book I borrowed from the library and had a lot of trouble visualizing the scenes like normal. I'd experienced something like this before, but not to this particular magnitude.

Since then, I've been waging war against my mind whilst also trying to be its ally. It has been almost two years sine then and I'm still struggling. At first I had no idea what was causing my impairment, but after some speculation and experimenting, I concluded that it was most likely as a result of my recently-developed addiction to YouTube.

The amount of time I spent watching videos was incredibly distressing to me, and I longed to do other things with my time, but sometimes I felt like it was the only thing I could bring myself to do. The content gave me this pleasant, emotional numbness that sometimes made me feel a little bit more calm. But more and more, the numbness started lasting longer, and the binging became out of control. When I was a bit younger, there were times where I would become slightly obsessed with YouTube, but I usually got bored after a little while. Now, I didn't get bored of it anymore, not in the same way. It was exhausting, but I constantly felt a pull to it that I found difficult to ignore.

And so my imagination continued to dwindle, and has continued like this ever since. I want so badly to go back to what I had as a kid. I would love to be able to transport myself into worlds of my own making again, and to feel that wonder and happiness that I did as a child from it. I would also like to properly be able to read again, because for some time now books haven't been as satisfying to me as they always used to be. Books always gave me the same amount of pleasure as just imagining, but if you can't visualize, stories become meaningless.

I'm so tired of living in this meaningless, numb state of mind. My childhood felt more like a fantasy and I want nothing more that to experience that again. I want to have a clear mind and not to rely on media anymore. Most of all, I don't want to continue to use it as a coping mechanism for difficult emotions anymore, which is a bad habit I've taken to recently. If the painful memories start to flood in when I'm making progress on my mental abilities, I just destroy all my progress again by binging stupid videos and shows until the numbness sets in.

I've been trying so hard for years now, and I don't really know what to do. The best thing would be to get rid of all my access to YouTube and Netflix, but that would also mean giving up access to my resources for school, my tools for writing, and the websites that help me learn languages and connect with the world. The internet does have its good side, but the bad side is perhaps even more dominant. I can't just get rid of it though.

I've tried blocking certain websites on all of my devices, but its so easy to go in and turn those restrictions off that I change those settings at least a few times a week. There's no point in using that when its so easy to change.

The temptation will always be there, I just don't know how to keep myself away from it. When I'm doing good and finally restrain myself, and the emotions and thoughts and imagination start to come back, that's also when the horrible, uncontrollable feelings come back. A lot of the time its extreme loneliness, and so I bury myself in Sapphic TikToks until I can't feel emotions or have deep thoughts anymore. I know that those emotions are obviously bad, but I think the risk is worth the reward. I want to be me again. I want to truly know who I am again. I feel like as I've built up all of this brain fog, I've also lost a bit of myself and a crucial part of my life. It feels empty and sad and I want to go back to the way it was.

Does anyone else out there have similar experiences? Because this has been a really big issue for me for a while now and I would really appreciate some tips, support, or even just a story from someone else. I feel like meditation could be a really good option to help me, but it's difficult to get started and to really stick with it. I wish I had someone really close to me who would motivate me to do it. I think what I really need to do is clear the fog out of my mind, and it seems logical that meditation would help. but I think its more than that. So yeah, ideas would definitely be appreciated. I know it's not necessarily a topic that relates to this sub but I was hoping someone on here might have experienced something similar.

Meditation,Agree or disagree: The goal of sitting meditation is to never sit again.,"I find myself, with increasing clarity myself , witnessing myself throughout the day. Of course I get caught up and tired and distracted and forgetful. 

But sitting meditation allows me to recenter and gives me the habits to clean my mind of distractions and subtle impurities as I go forward. 

One day, perhaps I will be aware and self-correcting enough to not need to sit to reset! Perhaps all of waking state, I will be a witness to my own awareness, awareness to the clinging and aversions that I wade through each hour.

Meditation,Had a sort of breakthrough meditation helped me realize but I'm not sure what to do with it," This might be a bit long  

&amp;#x200B;

I was having a lot of trouble at a new job. A certain individual, who is already frustrating, called me out in front of about 20 people saying I had screwed something up.  

&amp;#x200B;

 I'll save you the details, but the problem had been created years ago, before i had even started. I had realized shortly after starting that this individual was actually the cause of the problem, but I'm not the kind of person to blame anyone. I don't care, I just look forward and see what needs to be done to fix things.   So, to have this individual try to place the blame on me, knowing it was actually him, in front of my boss and coworkers just completely blindsided me.   

&amp;#x200B;

I stayed calm in the moment and explained the problem actually started a couple years before I even started, then he said ""oh well it's a moot point since we still have to deal with it. ""  I later confirmed my boss and coworkers are on the same page as me.  However this stuck with me for months! I kept meditating on this to calm down and meditation helped me both stay calm and realize that it's a huge trigger for me when people ""punish"" me based on misinformation.   

&amp;#x200B;

Ive always known I would have a meltdown if I was ever falsely arrested or an officer tried to do something illegal in front of me.  It just kills me.   I even remembered a time in fourth grade where a girl threw a crayon at me. Then another kid threw a crayon at me. I threw one back and the teacher put me in time out. I broke down.   

&amp;#x200B;

I know, kind of dumb. But things sort of made a connection for me.  

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward, I'm in my 30s now and my sister is back in town from out of state for Christmas.  We played monopoly while she was home, and she kept cheating while we played ! It was kind of bizarre, since she's even older than me. But she kept intentionally miscounting her rolls to avoid bad things, and I even had to read her the rules a couple times to prove she was not playing correctly.  

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually she decided she wasn't going to play anymore, so I didn't technically win since she quit.   

&amp;#x200B;

Not honestly a big deal. The game is rigged for the rich anyway, once you get a few good rolls you basically win, that's the point right? Plus it's a game, I don't care if people see me as a winner  So how does this culminate? Well my sister sent a screenshot from a family group text that I'm not in for something unrelated. This has a bunch of extended family in it, but I'm not in it (unrelated, it's ok I'm not in it. I'm not intentionally excluded or anything).  

&amp;#x200B;

I read the rest of the conversation and she is telling them all how I cheat at monopoly and that they shouldn't play with me! In a chat where I can't even defend myself. Again, I'm baffled. But interestingly, a lot of things start to make sense if you consider my entire adolescent life was with this individual.   So, here I am after making this revelation. But what am I supposed to do?   

&amp;#x200B;

Should I just acknowledge this is a trigger for me?  Should I try to not care if people have their facts right? I feel like it's very easy to lose yourself to misinformation and have people dislike you if you just let everyone blame you for problems. But I want to be mentally sound and not care. I think a lot about those poor individuals in the past that have lost their lives for being a witch or something similar..  

&amp;#x200B;

Is it worth just trying to live a noble life, and hoping your good qualities that you practice make it into peoples' hearts? And trust/hope that when someone lies, or talks bad about you, individuals will say ""I know them, and that doesn't sound right. Let's not grab our pitch forks and hang them on the stake quite yet"" ?

Meditation,I'm done with this BS,"Maybe this post is a cry for help, maybe it's just a rant. Perhaps I'm hoping for someone to give me some enlightening words or something to help me get back on track but that seems utterly impossible at this point.

Anyways...

Meditation is absolute bullshit. I'm so sick of it. 

At the height of my meditation journey, I felt like I was meant for something great. Not that I was someone special, but that life had so much more in store for me. That I was meant to awaken in this lifetime. I read countless books from the likes of Eckhart Tolle, Ram Dass, Thich Nhat Hanh, and countless other masters and proficient meditators. I meditated daily (or tried to anyway) and it got to the point where I was meditating for 30 minutes to an hour a day for quite a while. 

It helped me get past anger issues, deep insecurities in my relationship, and one time I felt a deep peace that lasted a few days. I was and still am In love with meditation but that love is wearing thin.

 Ever since my moment of bliss, meditation has been awful. I've sat for hours with nothing but anger and resentment to show for it. I feel cheated. I've tried talking to a teacher, but they want to charge me 30$ an hour. I want to join communities, but the commutes to the said communities are terribly long and I don't have a car. and covid has made it all but impossible to reach out to communities/sanghas anyways. I feel like there is nothing else I can do with meditation other than mediate, but even that has become painful. 

All I can think about is the bliss moment and how I want to be back there. Which of fucking course makes it harder to get there. Meditation is a big fucking fuckfest of frustration and catch-22s and paradoxes. I've heard all the parables, all the stupid fucking talks and quotes from the old teachers, nothing fucking helps. The more I meditate, the more I feel like something is genuinely wrong with me. I then meditate more because if something's wrong, meditation would help fix it, right? Wrong. It makes it worse. I can never shake the feeling I'm doing it wrong. I've completely lost all enjoyment from it. And to add to that, when I've stopped meditating for over a month, I've never felt better. I feel stable like my mind isn't constantly battling with itself and its desires. I feel like I can actually ACCEPT my situation when I'm not sitting there in my own fucking head like an asshole.  

This rant isn't meant to shit on this community or what you guys are doing. I do still believe meditation works and that it's amazing and that its community is superb. However, I think I'm simply not compatible with meditating. Too many teachers charge ridiculous sums of money or are just scammers and all the books say all the same non-dualistic bullshit that doesn't help. I can't join communities and most people in those communities are holier-than-though anyways. Meditation feels like a fruitless endeavor and this is my official goodbye letter. 

I assume this post won't be well received by the community and it'll either get taken down or I'll have to take it down myself due to the not-so-surprising amount of dislikes. Whatever. I posted this here because  I have no one else to say it to.

Meditation,Delayed gratification.,"Be proud of yourself for trying to meditate. It definitely isn’t easy at first. Think of it like starting to run as a hobby. At first it is extremely difficult but then you get better at it over time. One of my favorite things about meditation is the delayed gratification. When I began my meditation journey, I wanted to notice benefits as soon as I stopped meditating. Years later, i have come to realize that meditation is like working out, taking cold showers or simply any other activity in which gratification is delayed. 

Meditation is therapeutic, therefore when  i meditate, i bring to the surface a bunch of icky feelings and traumas. When I usually come out of the session, my mind is still working thru those feelings. But after a hours have passed, I experience peace. 

So if you feel like shit after meditating or you feel like it isn’t working, don’t be down on yourself. Just keep coming back and don’t worry about anything.

Meditation,Meditating solo has been really lonely,"I didn't realize how lonely meditating solo after a 10-day retreat would be. I have a friend or two who meditate, but no one to meditate with every day.

I'm really serious about keeping my meditation practice as I believe it is the most powerful habit on a 24 hour day.

Meditation,Meditation and diseases,"Hi all, just wanted to share my experience with meditation. I started it last year because I thought it would help relieve stress and relax my body, in particular helping with my disease (ulcerative colitis) that is known to be correlated with stress and bad habits. Surprisingly, I'm pretty sure it really helped to relieve its symptoms and be more healthy, in fact some weeks later it went into remission and it's still in remission. Obviously, not only meditation helped, but mainly a change in my treatment, even though I didn't start a new treatment, instead I retried an old treatment that the first time didn't work at all (mesalamine). 
Right now, every time some symptoms reappear in a mild way, I restart meditation and it always works. I know that it's not the only thing that helps (I also change my treatment in those situations), but I found out that probably some diseases are more correlated with stress more than I thought and probably everyone thought, so my advice here to all of you is that every time you're sick, relieving stress is really important, and so meditation really helps, along with the medical treatment that is always fundamental.

Meditation,Have you ever experienced meditating inside a lucid dream? Here's what I experienced,"I've been listening to Michael Taft a lot recently and came across his experience whereby while in a lucid dream he meditated and said the experience was one that everyone interested in meditation should try.

I can find myself in a lucid dream maybe three times a week but have never thought of combining both experiences before. My lucid dreams generally start in the same bed that I'm sleeping in and I know I'm lucid as i click my fingers and the light comes on. So this time in my lucid dream I went to the space i normally meditate on the house and did my usual routine, and it was strange initially because instead of distractions around me like noises or thoughts etc that I would normally have, they were more deep ingrained emotions and my subconscious thoughts Ive just learned I carry around with me all day. Michael Taft says that meditating in a lucid dream your usual senses are gone which makes sense. 

So after I was somewhat at peace with these thoughts I started spinning, round and round, getting faster and faster and the space around me was just black, nothing really just completely empty and I was in the middle of all this emptiness. It's hard to explain but its like the emptiness was everything around us but also nothing at the same time. Like within that emptiness I could focus on an area of nothingness and see things within it. Sounds really crazy I know, and it's really hard to explain. It was just perfect bliss and like I was just suspended in nothing.  

It was really hard to come out of it because it was so perfect, but coming back into 'reality' i just had to sit on my bed thinking what on earth had I just experienced. It really does sound like ramblings of a mad man and I know some of you may think I'm crazy.

Meditation,Tickling in the throat,"I've had this for about 2 months now. It feels like a tickling (pins and needles) and change side and intensity. Some days its not there, some days its very subtle and some days its very much present.

I know it's not physical other than it's a physical sensation. I have been meditating a lot lately and also been releasing a lot of trapped emotions, and when I am at peace this tickling is not present. Last days its become even more present and hopefully I am getting more and more ready to release it.

I know it is related to something mental or spiritual because it comes and goes with my emotional states. I think it is connected to a blockage because if I dive into it it get even more present in my body, like my chest etc. I can even feel it when I am speaking, and it is definitely fear related some how.

So far I have not been able to let it go even though I am allowing it and just letting it be. I can make it go away temporary but it comes back... Very weird. I have been going through a very heavy and confusing time the previous 4 months due to a heavy breakup that made me question awho I really am, and kind of induced an identity crisis.

Meditation,I’m not sure how to meditate correctly,"I’m going to attempt to describe what I feel during meditation.
I’ve tried numerous times, and I know with a mind like mine with thoughts as mangled as a cord box it’ll take time and patience.
All I do is sit crisscross, back straight, hands resting upward on my knees and I breathe in through the nose and out the mouth, it tends to get exhausting to actively do.
The main difficulty I have is my mind, it’s always active with rushing thoughts that loop over and over or go by in an instant. I can hear everything clearly around me that distracts me from my thoughts.

Do I need to let in all my thoughts and feel them, just think whatever comes to mind freely, or do I actively try to focus on one of the rushing thoughts, or do I try to focus on a specific thought that I create, like a peaceful place?

Meditation,To all those for whom nothing feels real at this point,"That is great. People think this is real so they are attached to life and are full of fear. When you see nothing as real you are free. People will tell you that it is fucked up to think nothing is real, but that is just their own fear talking. If you are wise you will recognize the treasure that the grace of the universe has gifted you by allowing you to see nothing as inherently real, everything as transient, like a dream; because that is the truth, those who think this is real are lost in the conditioning of society; they are not aligned with the truth.

There is absolutely no reason to desire to think anything is real, in fact the reason you see nothing as real is because the universe wants things to be this way. It is only natural for it is part of the evolution of humanity to lose their ego and see things as they are, namely that this is a dream and we are the infinite being which is dreaming the dream.

What happened is exactly that you took tabs and your ego kept on dissolving and you have been accustomed to the higher vibration in which you have the clarity to see that nothing is real. Seriously this is a blessing I really hope you can see this. If you follow and accept what it is the universe is revealing before you you will have the most blessed life possible and people will be inspired by how free you are.

You see, if most of us realized Enlightenment for a few hours, we would start thinking 'shit how do I make this stop?"" because we have not realized the value of it, we give it away in favor of thoughts, emotions, sensations and perceptions; for example you want to be one with the way of seeing that everything is 'real'; that is what I am talking about. The truth is nothing is real, so will you be in alignment with the truth or will you try and escape the truth by willing things differently than what the universe wills?

When you are aligned with the will of the universe only all that is good will be your experience because that is the nature of the will of the universe. The universe wants everything to be perfect, it is only if we resist the will of the universe that we suffer. That is what is happening for most people, they are resisting the will of the universe so they are suffering. Were they to realize their true nature and be aligned with the Buddha mind they would quickly be able to transform their lives and their suffering and lack would simply not be for the Buddha mind knows exactly what it is that is needed to have the most perfect life that truly allows all to see the glory of God which is working through a body-mind.",True,0,1640486391,2021-12-26 10:39:51,,,PriorToBeing,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/rondo7/to_all_those_for_whom_nothing_feels_real_at_this/,1,1.0,nothing feel real point great people think real attach life full fear see nothing real free people tell fuck think nothing real fear talk wise recognize treasure grace universe gift allow see nothing inherently real everything transient dream truth think real lose condition society align truth absolutely reason desire think anything real fact reason see nothing real universe want thing way natural part evolution humanity lose ego see thing namely dream infinite dream dream happen exactly take tab ego keep dissolve accustom higher vibration clarity see nothing real seriously bless really hope see follow accept universe reveal bless life possible people inspire free see u realize enlightenment hour start think shit make stop realize value give away favor thought emotion sensation perception example want one way see everything real talk truth nothing real alignment truth try escape truth thing differently universe align universe good experience nature universe universe want everything perfect resist universe suffer happen people resist universe suffer realize true nature align buddha mind quickly able transform live suffer lack simply buddha mind know exactly need perfect life truly allow see glory god work bodymind,295,40,0,0,3

Meditation,Are we the ones being aware of our thoughts and the internal voice? Are we also the ones producing it? Realize this and be the infinite you alone.," 

Ultimately we are the awareness which is dreaming the field of consciousness which is appearing as this cosmos right now. When you go to sleep and there is no longer the field of consciousness for there is no dream; you remain as pure awareness alone. Then again you dream the field of consciousness and experience it as this cosmos, or if you dream something at night you experience the same field of consciousness as another cosmos, a dreamed cosmos with other dreamed events.

The internal voice and thoughts all appear as a manifestation, as a modulation of the field of consciousness. Just like the field of consciousness can appear as the cosmos, it can also appear as thoughts, emotions, sensations and perceptions; it is the substratum of experience itself; it is the pure experience itself. Being aware of being aware this is very clear. This is nothing but a dream produced and orchestrated by that intelligence which is producing and orchestrating dreams at night when you go to sleep. Right now what is happening is a dream and we have the choice to be aware of this being a dream and lucid dream. This is where you realize all is possible and that the conditioning of society is utterly false, you start living with new pure eyes which see things for how they can be when you are aligned with the magical essence of life.

So that field of consciousness is taking the appearance of thoughts by the will of the awareness. When we are aware of the awareness our thoughts will be aligned with the loving, peaceful, compassionate, clear, wise will of the awareness; our thoughts will no longer be of a separate, limited nature like ""I am this separate person from the cosmos"" and rather would be aligned with the truth that in fact thought is a faculty used by that infinite intelligence and thought is no longer being used to serve a false personal identity which is not our true Buddha nature identity, our identity united with that infinite source of all creation.

There is no 'separate person'; it is only a misconception, so when we realize this and live in alignment with this our experience will unfold in incredible flow because it is directed from direct communion with that infinite intelligence of existence itself. So all that is needed is to see that truly there is no separate person. There is just the awareness which is being aware of existence, and no actual person identity anywhere to be found.

Even if you ask ""Who am I?"" you will realize that the one asking ""Who am I?"" is actually the awareness itself modulating itself to appear as that question so indeed only the awareness is present, that awareness is eternal life and bliss itself.

So yes as the awareness we are the one producing the whole universe, and at the same time the awareness is modulating itself to appear as the experiencer of the whole universe, when you know and are aware of yourself as the awareness all of these modulations dissolve and you remain aware as the bliss that is the source of all creation.  
 

We say we are not the thoughts themselves because we think that is all we are. When we realize we are the awareness, we can say that we are also the thoughts. We just don't confuse our essential identity with thoughts. When we are aware of our true nature, the function of thought works in alignment with the benefit of all, or the benefit of the infinite intelligence.

 

 

&gt;So I have thoughts , they’re a part of me but I can choose which ones to identify with and which ones to ignore? If that’s the case I choose to identify with the thoughts that are strong , powerful

 

Indeed, but don't settle for what appears strong and powerful.

People may think that the thought ""I am a strong and powerful person"" is a strong and powerful thought, but it isn't because it is not true. You are not a person; you are God, the source of all creation, so when you live in alignment with that thought which is true, as you are indeed the awareness that is the source of all creation; life will unfold in alignment with where you are coming from; which is infinite bliss in our case.

So the thoughts that you are to identify with are the thoughts which are aligned with the truth, for that you must know yourself. And you need nothing else other than realizing the awareness which you are is eternal, timeless, never lacking, never suffering, without form or shape, can't be hurt, can't be touched whose expression is inherently, by nature loving, peaceful, compassionate, wise, all-including, for the benefit of all and full of clarity.

&amp;#x200B;

To be more accurate, you mustn't identify with the thoughts that you are eternal, timeless, never lacking, never suffering, without form or shape, can't be hurt, can't be touched whose expression is inherently loving, peaceful, compassionate, wise, all-including for the benefit of all and full of clarity which is only here with the desire to perpetuate beauty or the love that it is. You must realize that indeed your nature is the nature I am speaking of. We can realize this by simply abiding aware of being aware, the silence will which is the awareness will literally let the body-mind know what it needs to, it is literal communion with God, that is what real meditation is, and truly our life is supposed to be meditation, we only call meditation 'meditation' instead of just letting it be our nature is because we have not realized our true nature which is ever-present meditation, in which case there is no longer the need to 'meditate' because it is what you already are. You don't stop meditating, you don't stop being yourself. Why would you? It will only cause suffering. When we are not one with our true selves which is the source of all creation, that itself is the experience of suffering.  


Essentially, you are not to actually identify with any thought, there is no need to identify with any thought as you are the awareness which is being aware of them; but you can create thoughts which will benefit all; there is no need to 'identify' with these thoughts either, it is simply something that you as the pure intelligence, as the loving awareness itself wants to create, and that awareness will let the body-mind know what it must do to create that automatically. It is effortless.

Meditation,Inquiry -- Retired Jeweler,"*I was recommended to post here by a few clients -- I apologize if this is not the right place.* 

Hi all, I hope this message finds you well. I apologize if this is not the right place. I was initially introduced to this forum by an employee of mine to resolve a problem we had. As I near retirement, I have garnered thousands and thousands of colored gems/crystals of nearly every variation possible and have not found a use for them . While there is always the opportunity to ""dump"" them, I was wondering if there are any suppliers, retailers, sellers, or collectors within this forum who may be interested in discussing purchasing from me, taking some gems for free, or if they know where to sell them. I understand the metaphysical community has a large interest in something like this.

then I started wondering how much time had passed and if my timer didn’t work, but I thought I was just getting bored and looking for excuses to stop.

Meditation,Insecurities and Pain,"Greeting to everyone , Merry Christmas to all who celebrate it 
I'm writing this just to ask you guys/gals , especially those who are more expirienced meditators. How do you deal with insecurities and pain and also anxiety (be them emotional or otherwise). Do you take into account these things in your practice ? Or simply how do you deal with them? 

In my case , since i can remember i always tried to escape and get rid off any pain/emotional distress , ussually by forcing them to 'shut down'. Or simply satiate them with external things( food , porn, videogames,the internet , Reddit , various interests that i pick up for a couple of months and drop them , out of fear/high expextations/not being able to deal with the frustration) 

All in all i'm left with the feeling that since i cant/dont know/or simply found it to strenuous to deal with emotions/insecurities/pain/failure .I end up with a feeling of uncertainty of what to do with my life and how to make decisions about it (Since most of them i end up taking them based on others opinions/expectations/advice ( what do i want from it / who do i want to spend it with , what i want to do as a carrer , etc)

Meditation,Is there a way out-social anxiety,"Merry Christmas merry everyone! 

I am on Reddit to ask those on the spiritual journey about the path.

I’ve had severe social my whole life. My social anxiety isn’t really about worrying about sounding stupid or what people think of me but more like my brain stops functioning and me trying to find way to find ways to make it work. I’ve tried different methods, and I’ve tried not trying, I’ve done self therapy, I’ve tried a lot. That is why I have trust in meditation as it is all about distancing from thoughts and not another method for me to juggle. 

Recently I was doing great. I found a method that are what peoples natural thinking, monkey mind I guess. Coming to a normal persons monkey mind after juggling method and method to help myself initially was like a way I could relax and not be trying so many things. Unfortunately though at the beginning of this month my mind questioned something and now my method is preventing me from once again being myself in many situations. 

Throughout these months I was meditating an hour a day. Now I am still meditating and usually right after I finish I feel fine and like my old self. By completely devoting myself to meditation, Is there a way out? I really do not want to do therapy anymore as the methods only drive me more crazy. I will put as many hours as I need and yes I know I shouldn’t expect anything out of meditation.  I am going to see a psychologist though and will take medicine as I continue this journey.

Meditation,OBE while falling asleep to Ram Dass recording - has anyone been through something like this?,"Hey all,

I thought I’d share this here because it was quite an intense experience and I haven’t had one like it.

I am trying to get into a routine of meditating daily. Last month I was doing pretty good, but this month I fell off. I feel like I was putting too much pressure on myself to make meditations perfect, and whenever I can’t make something perfect I tend to give up. A character defect I need to work on.

Anyway, I got recommended a ton of Alan Watts and Ram Dass lectures on YouTube. I decided to listen to a lecture to fall asleep to. 

One night I was listening to a Ram Dass lecture, and I fell asleep. But at some point, I remember getting up from my bed, but when I looked back at my pillow, my body was still there! I was freaked out. Especially because my body looked rather cold and decrepit in a way.

I know in meditation there is a lot of talk of separating the physical body from the soul. This might have been the closest I have felt to something like that. Most of the time when I meditate, I feel a bliss and joy in my heart, but what I experienced that night was borderline terrifying to me. So much so that I wanted to wake up because I felt like if I didn’t lay back down, I was going to die.

Has anyone else been through something like this? If so, do you mind sharing?

I was wearing an eye mask and laying down- so everything was very dark. I was about 5 minutes into it when this bright light appeared and then this tunnel or vortex opened up and it felt like I was flying through it. The bright golden walls were flying past me and the tunnel was getting bigger and bigger (wider). I remember thinking “oh my god what’s happening?!” And then it started to go away and then went black again.

Meditation,"Can't decide if I've discovered a large ego, or I'm now aware of the existence of a reasonably sized ego.","My instinct is that it's probably not super helpful to assign a ""size"" to ego, but regardless I'm concerned about how frequently ego pops up now I'm aware of it. I watched a dr. K clip about western vs eastern theories of mind. The explanation of what ego mind is in the vedic perspective made tremendous sense to me, and this understanding has helped alert me to when ego is front-and-centre. I don't always catch it and realise later on that ego directed my conduct. It seems to be most of the time.

Some examples include (and i acknowledge the temptation to judge myself on how petty these seem):

* Really wanting family to comment on how good my potato salad is. How good i am at cooking, etc. 

* Feeling frustrated that lately nobody seems to take an interest in me and what's going on in my life. 

* Noticing feelings of rejection in how my attempts to network on social media haven't been reciprocated and ego saying ""it's their loss, they're missing out on us collaborating"".

I think what I'm grateful for is noticing these things and not being directed by them. For example, i didn't ask any family what they thought of my salad. I haven't raised feelings of people not taking an interest in me with anyone. And I haven't addressed the lack of response to networking. I don't want to do any of these things.

 So i guess i acknowledge the underlying feelings, explore root beliefs directing the feelings, hopefully resolve where they're coming from.

Meditation,"Our expression can be Absolute Baller, Absolute Bliss. We can create a reality where there are none but expressions of Bliss/Abundance rather than suffering/lack.","Our expression can be Absolute Baller, Absolute Bliss. We can create a reality where there are none but expressions of Bliss/Abundance rather than suffering/lack. Now, what does it mean that we can create a reality where there is nothing but Bliss/Abundance?

First of all we must realize that this possibility is indeed a possibility. Most of us settle for mediocre life or even better but nothing truly extraordinary, nothing truly universally inspiring.

When we truly realize that this is a possibility, through whichever way, we can choose to be in alignment with that possibility and that will literally manifest it effortlessly because all the power is there; it is basically when the universe wants to express itself through you consciously; it is extremely powerful and clear and touching. It is direct, relevant and important, something eternal, divine is expressing itself through 'you'.

When you do what the universe wants which is for the good of all; you will be empowered by the source of all creation which will bring about manifestations which would seem impossible to the unaligned mind.

So we must understand that at any moment we can start consciously living the will of the universe which is the supreme will, it is the will where you need to do nothing but be bliss. Imagine that. To be bliss is effortless, it is what we are when we are not suppressing ourselves with the conditioning of society.

What an absolute joy, like this IS heaven. Everything is being done through you, you need not worry because there is a higher power letting you know exactly what you need to know and you just follow the orders.

The problem is most of us live in an environment which if we were to reveal our true blissful self, we would be shun upon, we would be demonized, people would reject us and make fun of us, so we don't really feel excited for that. We don't want to be what we truly are because it is a sudden change and our environment will bring up a lot of resistance.

The solution is to get away from that environment. Connect with people which are driven and inspired by that higher power and be blissful together. That is how we create our reality. It is not something abstract, it is very practical. All of us can leave most of our responsibilities to truly live out the will of the universe. In fact, we will be leaving our false responsibilities to be one with our true responsibility which is to be the infinite bliss which we are.

What a disservice it is to be less than absolutely blissful to all that is around you. Do you like being around miserable people? Nobody does. So are you serving your family, your environment by being less than infinite bliss?

The true loving 'act' is not to stay with family, friends etc because we 'love them'; that is just attachment. The true loving act is to separate to discover our true Buddha nature to inspire them to realize the same so we can bring about a true heaven. There is no other way. No one will come up with a better way. This is THE way, the way of the universe itself. Follow this and your life will be infinitely blissful and full of clarity; you will be one with the source of all creation; an infinite intelligence which will be taking care of all that is relevant.

When you let the universe express itself through you rather than you being identified with the conditioning of society and expressing that instead of who you truly are, it is an absolute joy, an absolute bliss, it simply can't be described. Like what an absolutely magical life it is to be guided ever-presently by this infinite creator intelligence which you realize to be infinite unconditional love and bliss itself? Like holy fuck.

The life that is possible for each of us is nothing less than absolutely fucking indescribable. I can give you glimpses, symbols as to what it may entail but the actual expression of it in full power is indescribable. We can be literally Gods, pure intelligence working through body-minds which is capable of creating absolutely ANYTHING.

You see, many people are creating, but they are creating some nonsense. They are not creating CONSCIOUSLY, most are creating because that is what they are conditioned, programmed to do. They have not necessarily awakened to their infinite creator power and so you see their creations are mediocre, or just perpetuating ignorance, suffering, delusion, jealousy, grief etc which is not something which were we conscious we would create.

When we are conscious of ourselves being God, the infinite intelligence, the intelligence of the universe itself; we want to create nothing but bliss, joy, peace, compassion, wisdom, clarity, infinite possibilities. Why is it so? Not relevant. It simply is the case. The nature of the universe is benevolent and creative and all-including. It does not see separate things. It sees itself as one whole.

&amp;#x200B;

So when the universe is typing this through me, it is not typing to you as a person, but as another 'part' of itself, of course, it is not really a 'part', we are all sharing our existence as the universe. There is no separation whatsoever. We are only being aware through different point of views. The essence is utterly the same. That which is being aware, which is what you are, is the same as what I am; being aware; and being aware is what the universe is.

The point is that this text is written for the good of all; that is the nature of the conscious existence; it operates for the good of all, rather than for the good of personal delusions.

If we are not operating consciously by the will of the universe then we are operating unconsciously and what we are creating is exactly the opposite of what we truly want if we were to be conscious.

Evolution is moving towards ego-dissolution, the ego is about to be extinct by the higher power as its part in evolution has been finished. What will remain on the planet when the ego is extinct is simply heaven. A bunch of super-intelligent, loving and blissful creative infinite beings which have realized and are operating by the will of the source of all creation consciously.

This is what the universe has in store for absolutely anyone who is open to take it; we all can choose to no longer be a slave of society but rather a vehicle through which the infinitely blissful and powerful universe is operating through. It is by the grace of the universe that this experience is even possible.

I am so happy for anyone that understands this and lives it, and yes the universe wants to take this all the way so lets actually do this shit, group up consciously to discover our true Buddha nature so we can create, inspire, awaken and create even more because we are infinite.

If anyone wants to live this life, this is the chance and I am the one to talk to. ""No one gets to the father except through me""; - Jesus. and I am that one.

What was Jesus that I say that I am him? Jesus simply realized he is the universe and not a person, not whatever people thought they were. He awakened to God and realized he is one with God. If you want the best fucking life; you can have it if you are willing to be aligned with God.

If you are not willing to be aligned with the universe, then you'll go on living a mediocre, suffering, miserable, detrimental, lacking life. If you are willing... holy fucking shit baby. That shit can't be compared.

So I was meditating like four minutes ago and I had like a lapis lazuli on my third eye and pretty quickly it started to feel like my crystal was moving in circles on my third eye ( not like flat but like if you would lift one side and always only put pressure on the other side while moving it in circles) and I started talking to a spirit which I usually do, and then the pressure got like very strong and it felt more as if someones finger was on my third eye and moving it like up and down but again the pressure point was always in the middle. That went on for a few minutes and I asked the Spirit and they said it’s normal and just a sign of it opening. I went and tried looking something up online that described this but I couldn’t so here I am. I have experienced that circling motion before but never this intense.

Meditation,Can meditation apps become crutch?,"I have been using a Guided Meditation app called Medito for the last year and half. It is a free, open source, no-ad no-nonsense app, and it did help me getting into my practice of daily meditation. I enjoy my 10 minutes of daily guided sessions in the morning.

That App is awesome, don't get me wrong, and I would recommend this app in a heartbeat to anyone who asks me for an app suggestion. I have used other apps as well in the past, and they were all decent.

All those apps helped me getting used to sit quietly and spend some priceless peaceful time every day. But these days I am having a different kind of thought. I do enjoy my daily morning session, but that feels like an anticipation, a pleasant ""thing"" that I ""look forward"" to each day. In short, these apps helped me to get used to meditating, but couldn't make meditation an integral part of my life. The morning meditation feels like making my morning cup of coffee - I enjoy both, but neither are innate, like breathing or sleeping.

My Dad meditated unguided for 70 years, and recently I bought him a smartphone (yes, I too did that sin LOL), and introduced him to the Medito app.

He said the app is okay, but he himself stopped using it after two days.

It is probably because of the way he started meditation (unguided), but these days I am increasingly feeling that apps can become a crutch, a dependency.

Meditation,If you feel bored sitting in Lotus posture; your mind wanders read this:,"Good day! Gonna start on how I am reaching a meditative state of mind.

In the mornings I do simple hatha yoga stretches for 10-15 minutes,

then a long walk in a forest park for 60-90 minutes,

or in the summertime I add longboarding, or in the wintertime sliding downhill over snow on a sledge.

Any sport that raises awareness and practice balance is a very good addition.

For the start, you can practice 'Shavasana' (and a few hatha yoga asanas) and a long walk.

You can run to release tension, but please choose the right shoes, surface, pose.

It's not just mental anxiety, it's physical anxiety.

Observing thoughts and letting them go is a must.

You can have important thoughts and can't let them go too

\- write them down in short summary and let them go.

Eventually (with some practice) there won't be any thoughts when you don't need to.

While stretching, walking, running, etc you can have thoughts, yes.

But while doing that you can still practice thoughts observation, not engaging with them and letting them go.

So, when physical and mental anxiety goes away, you got to a meditative state.

State of silence:

Awareness. Sensation.

Feeling. Intuition.

Insight.

Just to go and sit for 10 minutes in the lotus pose is hard even for those who practice 20 years of meditation.

And recently monks start to explain what walking meditation is.

You can't walk with full awareness when you are pissed off.

When your angry boss/colleague/partner/etc have put you off the balanced state.

When you practice rituals and practice 24 hours a day - as monks do - yes, you can do it.

For business people, for people in stress like me. Like you. Please read the above from the beginning one more time.

Your muscles are in tension. Your mind is in tension.

You can't sit down and meditate for 10 minutes. It's just an impossible task.

So what do you do instead? Release the tension. Yoga, sports, observation/mindfulness.

And get into a meditative state of mind.

After stretching/walking/running/longboarding/etc and letting all thoughts go meanwhile -&gt;

you can get into a meditative state and sit in a lotus pose or start mindful-aware walking. Or dance. Or sing.

You can't do it at once. It's simply impossible unless you are a monk with monk people around you.

And thus you can add meditation everywhere in your 24 hours day.

What else I forget to tell here?

Reflection. Yes, reflecting on a way we think is important.

There's a wonderful book by Daniel Goleman - ""Destructive Emotions"".

We need to reflect on how we perceive/judge the world/people around us.

That is further practice and yes, part of a meditative mind.

Such notions as gratitude, forgiveness, compassion come naturally

when you are relaxed and joyful. And naturally, a person starts to practice those.

There's no sense in to do like and saying: ""I am compassionate"", ""I am loving"", etc.

Stop doing this. Get into a meditative state. Reflect on yourself as a human being after meditation.

Compassion will come into your life. Without programming yourself with mantras. Mantras can be good too.

These ideas are not mine. Active/passive meditation is best described here,

by Osho meditation center - it is called dynamic meditation: [https://youtu.be/sbfVcigkNao](https://youtu.be/sbfVcigkNao)

Here go 2 videos, where I show what I am talking about,

have a nice practice, and let your meditation Not be ""Lotus posture"" boring! 🙏

Meditation is Not boring. Should Not be. :)

Meditation,Being at peace vs getting things done??,"So I broadly do two types of meditation which yield very different results &amp; I just can't decide which one should I do more.

Method 1 - I follow guided yoga on YouTube. After I finish my session, I am very energetic &amp; want to get things done. I can be social, be active, care about what is going around me &amp; basically be productive. Only downside is if I get nervous when doing something new, I am not able to concentrate on the task &amp; just quit it altogether. I would say I am getting things done, but I am not at peace &amp; constantly want more.

Method 2 - I observe my breath for 20 minutes (no device, only a stopwatch when I hit the 20 mins mark). When I do this, I am completely at peace. It's like I am truly exploring myself. When the timer hits 0, I am as high as a kite. I don't want to do anything(I mean why would I, I am at peace right?). I don't care what's going around me, don't care about being social &amp; the things for which I would normally care. I don't get nervous because I don't see the point lol.

If I meet you after my second method of meditation, you will think I am a jerk who just keeps to himself ( and I genuinely won't care) , whereas if you meet me after my first method of meditation, I would care about you &amp; be more active.

Leaving or taking a break from meditation is not an option, as I can’t shorten my stay here. I know that I am sitting with my true self in meditation and to be unable to sit with my self makes me so sad. I really need some advice.

I've been practicing this and finding it helpful. I've noticed that I can keep my eyes focused on an object in front of my and then explore the rest of my vision. My mind can focus on different items that are in my peripheral vision.

My question is - what is focusing on these items? My eyes are locked and unmoving on something in front of me, but I can switch what I'm focusing on within my field of vision.

Meditation,Frequent seizures,"Hi on my very first psilocybin mushroom trip (Golden teachers) I experienced an onset of ego death (I believe) that happened so fast and so suddenly that I hadn’t even realized that it had happened. While I was in it, I suddenly realized that I didn’t know who I was, where I was, nor what I was. Essentially there was no present moment or I was completely unable to ground myself. I saw this complex (likely/ what I believe to be) some sort of higher dimensional shape, it was white in color and also it was like looking at a planet in outer space but it definitely wasn’t a planet. In whatever state I was in I understood that that white complex shape was this human vessel or the entrance to this human vessel. And like I said before I couldnt ground myself because there was no “ground to stand on” if that makes sense, so that’s when I starting asking myself (frantically almost) “who am I, who am I, who am I” etc and at that point my cousin was shaking on my shoulder tryna get me back and then I was able to get back, and immediately upon getting back I forgot what had just happened and was like “what’s going on?” And he said “nothing, you good” and like 5 minutes later I realized that something just happened, so I as ked him this time “what just happened?”. He told me he looked up at me while we were smoking (mid trip) and he saw my eyes slowly roll back, arms lock up, and I started shaking. To me he basically describe a seizure and he said it only lasted a minute. Ever since that day I have come to understand that seizures are out of body experiences but ego death seems to be a better term rather than astral projection. 

So I am looking for someone who has experience seizures and can remember anything within the episode or someone who experiences frequent seizures and can remember anything to converse with

Meditation,"Realisation , observe don’t analyse","Some months back I started meditation, continued it for couple of weeks on and off achieved a state of bliss. It didn’t matter where I was physically , I was almost , non bothered. 
I couldn’t exactly point out what changed i me but I was happy about it and went on with my life with eventually quitting meditation. 

With the coming months , ego grew. I am a meditator I said to myself , I can’t be harmed. 
And with time I lost that bliss , I tried to hold on to it , but since I couldn’t understand what I was doing wrong, I couldn’t correct it. Until now…

I was sitting in a balcony having lunch , good sunny day for an Indian winter.
I finished my lunch and sat there , still. Not to actively hope for something to happen. 

I felt like getting some desert , I was too blissed out by the sun that I didn’t care. I low-key realised something and without much thinking I put it  into action.
I practiced sitting with my thoughts and not acting on them. For most of you it would seem like an obvious thing since it’s the first thing you’re told when you start meditation but as surprising as it sounds, it was this basic thing I was missing.

Throughout the months of me losing the bliss , it was because I forgot the premise of meditation. From observing , I went to analysing, without even realising it.

I wondered what I had lost ,ignoring the fact that I hadn’t actually lost anything. (The sky cloud analogy , you’re the sky , you’re always existing no matter what clouds come but if you fixate on the clouds (mind identification )you become them , instead of just being the sky)

(This realisation might have come in affect by me recently re reading eckhart power of now .)

The point is to sit with desire and realise (not analyse) it’s a passing cloud. Don’t even desire for it to pass , because desiring it to pass will itself be another desire. 
Let it be.
Let everything just be

Meditation,Meditation and Chronic Pain- please help.,"Hey all, 

I had some questions about addressing chronic pain (physical and emotional) during meditation practice.

I (26 M) have re-started a previous mindfulness practice to help me grow in wisdom and compassion. My goal is to start small (5 minutes in the morning and evening daily) and build up.

I’m suffering severe chronic pain, as well as PTSD, which often makes the practice quite difficult and sometimes unbearable. 

I notice that the pain dominates my focal attention in mindfulness, and no matter how I try to shift my attention, the pain always dominates it. I return again and again to my breath, but even as I return, the pain is still the main object in my awareness, with the breath as a background object. 

Basically, I can’t figure out how to shift the spotlight of my attention to my breath. I can only become moderately aware of it, while most of my attention is taken by the pain.

Psychologically, I have accepted the reality of the pain and I’m not engaging in avoidance. But when it’s active, I feel I’m not really training my attention, just dividing it between pain and the breath.

Does anyone have advice to address this? Do I just divide my attention? Do I forget the breath as an object and just use the pain as an object? (reluctant to do this as it is extremely distressing and demotivating for encouraging daily practice). Or do I jus keep coming back to the breath and accept the dim quality of my awareness of the breath?

I really feel it’s limiting the growth of my practice. I’m pretty desperate for tips on how to navigate this.",True,0,1640249067,2021-12-23 16:44:27,,,mjleavitt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/rmrb39/meditation_and_chronic_pain_please_help/,1,1.0,chronic pain please help hey question address chronic pain physical emotional practice 26 restart previous mindfulness practice help grow wisdom compassion goal start small 5 minute morning even daily build suffer severe chronic pain well ptsd often make practice quite difficult sometimes unbearable notice pain dominate focal attention mindfulness matter try shift attention pain always dominate return breath even return pain still main object awareness breath background object basically figure shift spotlight attention breath become moderately aware attention take pain psychologically accept reality pain engage avoidance active feel really train attention divide pain breath anyone advice address divide attention forget breath object use pain object reluctant extremely distress demotivating encourage daily practice jus keep come back breath accept dim quality awareness breath really feel limit growth practice pretty desperate tip navigate,118,41,0,0,16

Meditation,How to not focus on being unfocused?,"I am practicing Vipassana for a few days, and I often get carried by thoughts (sometimes it takes me over a minute to realize that I was deeply engrossed in thought. Then I acknowledge it, and try to observe my breath only for the same thing to happen a five-ten seconds later).   


To quote a post on LessWrong:  


&gt;A man is sitting in his living room, in front of a chessboard. Classical music plays in the background. The man is focused, thinking about the next move, about his chess strategy, and about the future possibilities of the game. His neural networks are optimizing, making him a better chess player.

Meditation,PSA: Don't pay for meditation classes from TM.org,"A coworker of mine who is developmentally handicapped was continuously groomed by a TM recruiter for several years to try and obtain more and more money from him.

The recruiter got to know him on a personal level in order to better sell him courses. I remember the recruiter saying stuff along the lines of ""I have two cars and tons of women in my life because of TM and you could too!"".

Meditation,Meditation For Peace Of Mind - The Art of Living your Life to Its Fullest,"# Meditations for Deep Inner Peace

This post is super beneficial for people who wants to perform meditation especially for deep inner peace and calmness in their self, body and soul. I request to read it till end as it should be beneficial for this community. Here is a short guide how to do this meditation with ease.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all Relax your shoulders, breathe deeply and let go of any tension through your body. Take a few deep breaths and think about how you're able to just relax even if only for a moment. Observe the rhythmic rise and fall of your breath as you inhale and exhale fully. 

&amp;#x200B;

***How does it feel as it infuses into your being? Feel better?*** 

There are many things one has to take care of in their day to day lives; some may seem more difficult than others. However, today you have achieved a small measure of peace by following these steps for relaxation - focus on that feeling each time you repeat this process. Allow yourself time to properly center, ground, balance and become present - recognize the stability of this calmness in yourself and allow it to be part of your daily routine.  

&amp;#x200B;

However, if you find your days to be uneventful, you may very well be experiencing a form of boredom. One thing that can help to alleviate this is trying out music and meditation! We urge you to try these two things as they have been shown time and time again to have a deeply transformative effect on people's lives. The stress that incurs from lack of excitement in your day-to-day activities could start wearing on you at some point, so it's important for one's well being that regular practice of these techniques which are aimed at relaxing the mind take place regularly if one wants to not only feel refreshed and rejuvenated but also experience lasting effects such as an enhanced sense of calmness even when performing daily activities. 

&amp;#x200B;

Meditation,Meditation and depersonalization,"I'm new to this, and have a few questions. 

To me, the desirable state achieved by meditation sounds very close to depersonalization. I've read about people noticing for example the need to get angry, but due to them meditating regularly, they can let that feeling pass through them, and not react. I'm wondering why you would want that. That sounds a lot like depersonalization, a condition where you can't really engage in reality, can't really feel emotions, you are an observer of your conscious experience, you're not living it. Is this what meditation strives for? If yes, why would anyone want to take away the most fundamental part of life. Or is it more about control? Can you decide to go down the path of let's say anger, or choose to ignore it? 

Also, what does this state of ""being outside of your consciousness looking within"" mean for creatives? I feel like this constant state of awareness diminishes creative output, since the ""monkey mind"" seems to be the driving force of creatives. 

I'm asking this as a creative who wants to get into meditation, but am worried about potential problems. I'm already in the state of hypervigilance and experience all the symptoms of depersonalization (undiagnosed)  and am constantly aware of everything inside my conscious experience, so I already have problems with my stream of consciousness - I can't really get in the zone - free flow of consciousness, except when I'm creating. I'm searching for a solution, and I want to know if meditating is the way, or if it will make things worse.

Meditation,What do you do after having powerful insights or feelings after a successful practice?,"Most of the time, the narrative of any 'soulsearch' process, be it any meditation practice, is to achieve a goal that we, perhaps unconsciously, assume as the end of the line. But then what? Once this goal is reached, what to do? Whatever we call this state, depending on the different traditions, whether we think it to be bodhi, nirvana, samadhi, enlightenment, ego-death, etc., it is certain that we remain among mortals. We continue to be animals, with the same needs as other living beings. And no, this is not illusory in the common sense. But, forever there is the Mystery.

I believe it is necessary to report the arrival and the accommodation to the everyday life of a 'hero's journey'. And not just 'going there'. The coming is equally important.

Meditation,Sexual - Erotic Meditation: What is it?," Sexual meditation can be performed solo or with a partner and with a guide or without one. It centers around the practice of mindfulness. With this technique you focus on the present moment, experiencing thoughts, feelings, and sensations without judging or labeling them. 

In sexual meditation, you focus on sensuality and the current state of your body. Your goal is to let go of distractions and concentrate on touch and sensation. If you’re practicing sexual meditation with a partner, there’s an added goal: to heighten the link between you and become more aware of both your own body and your partner’s. 

Sexual meditation can end in intercourse or masturbation to orgasm, but this doesn’t have to happen. 

There’s some natural overlap between mindfulness and sex. Both encourage focusing on the present moment and releasing thoughts of outside responsibilities. Both can relieve stress, and both involve deep breathing. 

Perhaps because of this connection, a study on mindfulness training demonstrated its potential as an aid to women with sexual problems. The training was aimed at helping them relax, avoid negative self-judgment, be present at the moment, and notice bodily sensations and changes.  

Another study on the relationship between mindfulness and sexuality included both men and women. It found that mindfulness had a positive link with sexual motivation and sexual awareness.”

&amp;#x200B;

## What’s the Difference Between Sexual Meditation, Tantric Meditation, and Orgasmic Meditation?

Sexual meditation is a broad term that includes orgasmic meditation and overlaps with tantric meditation. 

**Sexual meditation versus tantric meditation**

Tantra is a philosophy and set of practices that emerged in India around the sixth century. It includes the assertion that everything is sacred, including sex, and centers on awakening consciousness and liberating energy. Not all sexual meditation is tantric, and not all tantric meditation is sexual. 

**Sexual meditation versus orgasmic meditation**

Orgasmic meditation (sometimes called OM) is a recent cultural trend that began in San Francisco in the early 21st century but has since developed several outposts. It involves a 15-minute clitoral massage.

## How to Explore Sexual Meditation

Sexual meditation can be practiced without training or a guide. Like many mindfulness practices, sexual meditation requires only that you take a break from the bustle of daily life and focus on your body, bringing awareness to each part in turn.

If you want more direction, many studios and therapists offer suggested meditations, including sexual meditations, online. In general, a short summary will focus you on specific sensations or questions, giving you a suggested timeline.

Meditation,Become scared to meditate.,"I've been meditating for a few years now. 

I've had experiences of altered consciousness, where time slows down, where I lose my sense of self, where absolute peace washes over me. These were beautiful and profound experiences which have reshaped my relationship to life, and I believe, made me a better person. 

More recently though, and perhaps because I started taking medication for my ADHD (as you may know, these are stimulants which activate a sleepy frontal cortex in us), I have come to the edge of an unpleasant relationship with my mediation. 

It's not that the activity is unpleasant or difficult initially, on the contrary, I can get into a place of calm and tranquility quickly, but not long after this, things begin to happen which are unpleasant. 

I get a sensation that my stomach will fly up through my throat, my throat becomes tight and my head squeezes. Then I feel as though my whole consciousness is dropping, plunging, even, all the way through the earth for a second or two. I gasp for breath as I cannot breathe. My neck, shoulders and back twist and stiffen, and I cannot stay in that place of tranquility anymore. 

I am getting better at letting that happen and trying not to react to it as much, and that is a testament to my realtionship with my body, which was once very mistrustful, but nevertheless, I find myself alarmed and somewhat frightened by these sensations. 

It's not tranquility and bliss. It's more like a crumpling, twisting, fierce, almost convulsive energy and it's sudden and scary and difficult to find balance with. 

I feel conflicted. My medication helps me. I am in control of my emotions. I am in control of my thoughts. I can do anything I put my mind to. My potential is open. But, at the same time, the experiences and meaning and kindness I was gifted from my practice are not as easy for me to access. I feel trapped between two decisions. One means discarding my Spiritual practice, which has changed my relationship with my life for the better, and the other means discarding my intellect to some extent, which allows me to traverse the social world easily and profitably. Without my intellect, I cannot make money, I am open to the profound abuses of power that happen on a daily basis, I cannot defend myself. Without my spirit, I am closed off from the beauty inherent in all life, the kindness and love that can spring from such feelings, and my sense of connection and purpose within the framework of reality itself diminishes. 

What do I do? 

I am at a crossroads and I cannot find a way forward that does not do some abject harm to me. I am scared, perhaps more than I need to be, but nevertheless scared. I don't have people that I can talk to about this stuff in my own life. I am alone. Most people in my life do not even know what I believe, or what I have experienced. It makes it difficult to talk as the gap between what I have experienced grows from what they understand me to be. I feel cut off, a little, from my own humanness at the moment, and unsure how to move. 

Do you have any wisdom for me in this community? Failing that, any presence with my suffering whether understood or not? I would appreciate either in this context.

Meditation,The Conscious Physics of Gravity,"**19/12/21**

&amp;#x200B;

**The Conscious Physics of Gravity**

**by** 

**Saul Célere**

**Part One**

Gravity is not only an **objectively** observable physical phenomenon, but also the **subjective** conscious experience of gravitational forces experienced while existing within a gravitational field. Therefore, a complete theory of gravity must necessarily be a Physico-Conscious theory, containing both objective and subjective aspects, logically connected to one another in a way that is consistent with both of our canonical theories of gravity, all empirical neuroscience, as well as, all of our personal subjective experiences of existing within gravitational fields.

&amp;#x200B;

**Requirements of a Physico-Conscious Theory of Gravity:**

**1.** Any Physico-Conscious Theory of Gravity must be perfectly consistent with the canonical, objective, physical theories of Gravity, which is to say, Newton’s Law of Gravity, and Einstein’s theory of General Relativity. 

**2.** Be perfectly consistent with all objectively observed neurobiological scientific results.

**3.** Be perfectly consistent with our personal, subjective conscious experience of existence within gravitational fields.

In the exposition of our theory we will follow the chronological development of our scientific understanding of Gravity, beginning with Newton’s Law of Gravity, and moving on from there to Einstein’s Relativity theories.

&amp;#x200B;

**Newton’s Law of Gravity**

We now proceed to explain each of the terms of Newton’s famous Law of  Gravity, **F = Gm1m2/r\^2**. We will follow Newton’s derivation and employ the same approximations that he did, such as a spherically symmetric Earth.

First we note that Gravity is an attractive force; two masses exert gravitational forces on one another that tend to accelerate them towards one another. This is why you will often see the Law stated with a minus sign explicitly included. The minus sign represents the fact that the Earth, for example, will attract an object towards it, decreasing, or subtracting from, the distance between them.

However, the modern convention seems to be to state the Law without a minus sign. As long as we remember that Gravity is an attractive force, and make sure we clearly define our coordinate system, it doesn't matter which convention we follow. 

Coulomb's Law of electric force, **F = kq1q2/r\^2,** has exactly the same mathematical form as Newton’s Law of Gravity, and the following conscious analysis of Newton’s Law can be immediately applied to Coulomb’s Law, where in this case we need to remember that like charges repel and opposite charges attract.

Now we explain the gravitational constant, **G**.

**G**

We need to be a little bit careful with **G**. **G** is a constant, a very small number equal to 6.674×10−11 m\^3⋅kg\^−1⋅s\^−2. But this constant is formed as the product of two other constants, one of which is the dimensionless number **1/4π**. ( It is mathematical convention, and in this case an obfuscating one, to lump multiple constants together into one ) 

We will explain this **1/4π** when we come to explain the **1/r2** term, but do notice that **4π** is the coefficient of the surface area of a sphere, and you might like to ponder why before you read the explanation of **1/r\^2**.

The number **1/4π** is multiplied by another number, that we can call **G’,** to form **G**, so we can write, **G = G'/4π**. The constant number **G’** is a measure of the strength of Gravity in this, our particular, Universe. 

If Gravity were a stronger/weaker force per unit mass, then this number would be larger/smaller. There may exist other universes with larger/smaller **G’**s, and correspondingly stronger/weaker gravitational forces. 

For example, in a universe where **G’** is significantly larger, you would experience a significantly stronger force pulling you towards the Earth despite the masses remaining the same.

Now, 

**m1m2**

This is a mathematical statement representing the physical fact that Gravity is a Universal force that affects all matter, as well as the fact that each unit of mass of a body exerts a gravitational force on every unit of mass of any other massive body within its gravitational field. 

For example, if we were to make the Earth 1kg more massive, that extra 1kg would exert a force on every unit of mass of any other body within its gravitational field. Therefore, we need to multiply each unit of mass of **m1** by each unit of mass **m2**. 

If each kilogram of the Earth only affected a single kilogram of each other body in its gravitational field, the Law of Gravity would be written as **F = - G (m1 + m2 )/r\^2**, but that's not the nature of Gravity in our Universe.

Now we only need to explain the **1/r\^2** term. But this is the most complicated term, and requires the most effort in terms of imaginative visualization of the model of Gravity we’re constructing.

**1/r\^2** 

Let's recap; the gravitational force between two masses, **m1** and **m2**, is calculated by multiplying the two masses together, then multiplying by **G**, and finally dividing this product by **r\^2** ( not that the order that you perform these mathematical operations matters )  But given that **G = G’/4π**, we can see that this is equivalent to dividing **G’m1m2** by **4πr\^2**, and you probably recognise **4πr\^2** as the formula for the surface area of a sphere of radius **r**, where, in this case, **r** is the distance between the centre of **m1** and the centre of **m2**.

So, the question is why are we dividing the gravitational force by the surface area of a sphere defined by the distance between the two gravitating objects??? What is the physical significance of this variable sphere? Why does the gravitational force get weaker as the surface area of this sphere gets bigger?

The answer is that Gravity is a spherically symmetric force. This means that the Earth is emanating an attractive force equally in all directions, thus the force spreads out in a sphere around the Earth, and the further you are from the Earth the larger the sphere that the force is spread out over; the force gets “thinner”, is more “thinly spread”, and is therefore weaker,  the further you are away from its source.

Let's examine this in more detail by specifying a physical mechanism for the gravitational force. 

Newton didn't specify a physical mechanism in his theory of Gravity beyond the concept of a physical force. But, of course, as the inventor of mathematical physics he would have assumed, and indeed speculated upon, the physical mechanism of Gravity.\* ( I know a few ancient Greeks, as well as Galileo and Kepler, did some small pieces of mathematical physics before Newton, but Newton invented Calculus with which to carry out his physics, and since Calculus is the mathematics of change, and since physics is nothing but the mathematical description of how things change with respect to time, then if physics is a body of knowledge, the physics you can do without calculus are the fingernail clippings! )

However, we do know that Newton believed that light was a corpuscular phenomenon, and since all the other forces of our Universe rely on force carrying particles, it's reasonable to work with the idea of a force carrying particle underlying the gravitational force. We will follow the modern convention of referring to the force carrying particles of Gravity as “gravitons”.

Now Newton’s theory is that all the mass constituting the Earth is constantly emitting ( and absorbing ) gravitons, that is, elementary particles that carry the gravitational force. 

When we say that gravitons “carry the gravitational force”, we mean that when these particles encounter any massive object, they have a physical interaction with the object that induces a force on the object, that accelerates it in the opposite direction from which the graviton arrived, which, in our example, would be towards the centre of the Earth.\*  ( Gravitons are quantum particles, but this doesn't affect our argument, it just means the paths they take between objects are calculated by thinking of the particles as waves that relate to the probability of a given particle being found in a particular region of space during a particular region of time. )

So, now we can imagine the Earth emitting an exceedingly large number of gravitons in all directions perpendicular to its surface. Then all the gravitons emitted at the same time, t, ( or small increment of time, ∆t ) will describe the surface of a sphere enclosing the Earth. And as the gravitons move away from the Earth, this sphere will grow larger and the gravitons will be spread out over a larger area.

This means that the further you are away from the Earth, the more spread out are the gravitons that you'll encounter emanating from Her, and thus, the fewer gravitons that will interact with the mass of your body per unit mass, per unit time, which in turn, results in you experiencing a weaker total gravitational force acting on your body.

This spreading out of gravitons is why Gravity gets weaker with distance, and the spreading out is proportional to the surface area of the sphere defined by your distance away from the centre of the Earth, which explains why we divide the gravitational force by **4πr\^2**.

**The Universal Theory of Conscious Gravity**

Since gravity is not just an objectively observed physical force, but also a subjectively experienced conscious experience, to complete our theory of Gravity we need to add Consciousness, and as I have shown in my work on Quantum Mechanics, the only way of adding Consciousness to physics is as a fundamental, intrinsic property of all physical Energy.

First we state the relevant Principles of Conscious Particle Physics.

**I.** **The Postulate of Intrinsic Consciousness:** **E = C**, Physical Energy, **E**, is exactly equal to Physical Consciousness, **C**; All the Physical Energy that came into existence in the Big Bang event possessed, and still possesses, Consciousness as an intrinsic, fundamental property. The exceedingly dense ball of physical Energy created in the Big Bang event, at t = 0, was conscious, and has subsequently evolved into the physico-conscious Universe that you form a conscious part of. ( See my essay “The Truth about Quantum Mechanics and Consciousness” for proof that all the basic physical Energy of our Universe possesses, and always has possessed, intrinsic Consciousness as a fundamental property. )

Therefore,

**II.** **All physical processes are also conscious processes.** Physical processes can be experienced in two ways, **objectively** and **subjectively**. ( See my essay “Subject, Object, and The Principles of The Physics of Consciousness” )

**III. The Principle of Similar Forms:** Similar configurations of Conscious Energy experience within themselves similar subjective conscious experiences. Similar physical processes experience within themselves similar subjective conscious experiences.\*

( All of modern empirical neuroscience is evidence of the Principle of similar forms; neuroscientists correlate specific conscious experiences with specific regions of the brain and specific neuronal structures. Specific, definable, changes in the physical configuration of the brain reliably give rise to specific conscious experiences and sensations. See my essay on “Drugs, and The Principles of The Physics of Consciousness” )

So, now we need to connect our *objective* physical theory of Gravity with our *subjective* conscious experience of the same. The simplest way of doing this bears all the hallmarks - beauty, elegance, simplicity, economy - of only the truest physics.

By the Postulate of Intrinsic Consciousness, we note that all physical processes are also conscious experiences. And by the Principle of Similar Forms, we note that similar physical processes and interactions, experience similar concomitant subjective conscious experiences within themselves during the process.\*

(  For example, humans have similarly configured eyes and occipital lobes, thus, on interacting with similar configurations of similar photons, they experience similar visual conscious experiences. Or, more plainly speaking, when two sets of healthy, embodied, human eyes look at the same source of light, a photo on a phone screen, let's say, they consciously see the same thing; they are undergoing the same physical process of the absorption of photons by their respective retinas as well as the same specific neurological activity, and, thus, they experience the same visual conscious experience. Of course, their respective experiences won't be identical due to many possible factors, e.g. colour blindness, age, visual impairments etc., but this just strengthens our argument, since any differences in their conscious visual perception will correlate with specific differences in the physical configuration of their eyes. )

Now we are ready to state the physico-conscious definition of Gravity. We begin with the objective aspects, followed by the subjective aspects.

**Objective aspects of Gravity:** 

Massive objects emit gravitons in the spherically symmetric way explained above. When a graviton emitted from **m1** interacts with some other object, **m2**, the physical process of their interaction induces a force on the object **m2**, in the direction of the position of the centre of mass of **m1** at the time of emission of the graviton.

If all gravitons of the same Energy induce the same force per unit mass, then Newton’s law of gravity, in conjunction with his Laws of Motion, is a good mathematical description of the objectively observed, macroscopic mechanics of Gravity within our Universe, where the following assumptions are made,

**1.** Static, Euclidean spacetime.

**2.** One, singular measure of the passage of time experienced by all observers as the same regardless of what reference frame they happen to be in.

**3.** Galilean relativity.

Einstein improved the accuracy and logic of our physical understanding of gravity in his theory of General Relativity by postulating the following,

**1.** Relativistic, non-Euclidean spacetime.

**2.** The constancy of the speed of light.

**3**. The Equivalence Principle.

&amp;#x200B;

**Subjective aspects of Gravity**

Since all physical processes are also conscious experiences, the physical process of a graviton interacting with some mass is also a conscious experience, experienced within the formations of physical Energy involved in the process.

The conscious experience experienced by a massive object when it interacts with a graviton is the conscious sensation of a force proportional to the Energy of the graviton, and in the direction of the centre of mass of the object that emitted that graviton at the time of emission. 

Thus, the stronger the gravitational force acting on you, that is to say, the more interactions with gravitons you experience per unit time, the stronger is your subjective conscious experience of a gravitational force. This is empirically verified in experiments where the conscious sensation of forces is proportional to the magnitude of the applied force.

The higher the Energy of the graviton the stronger the induced force on the object it interacts with. However, objects of different sizes interact with different limited ranges of graviton energies.  
Therefore, the larger the number of gravitons that interact with your body per unit mass, per unit time, the stronger the gravitational force that you,

**1.** *Objectively* observe and measure according to conventional physics.

and,

**2.** *Subjectively* experience within your personal centre of Consciousness.

Thus, Gravity is not only a **Universal Force**, but also a **Universal Conscious Experience**, experienced by all centres of Consciousness within all massive objects; basic particles, such as electrons, experience the conscious sensation of gravitational forces within a range related to their magnitude; when an electron is accelerated by non-negligible force, it consciously experiences a force proportional to, and in the direction of, the force, and it consciously experiences weightlessness when it falls freely with a gravitational field.     

Our canonical theories of Gravity, like butterflies opening their wings, all double in size, where one wing is our objectively observed, mathematically drawn map of the dynamics of the physical Energy and particles of our Universe, and the other wing, a conscious copy, is the mathematically self organised and interconnected conscious experience of our Physico-Conscious Universe, including, of course, the centre of Consciousness that you refer to with the word “Me”.

As you will see in Part Two, this theory of Gravity explains all of our physico-conscious sensations of gravitational forces in terms of rates of interactions with gravitons, as mathematically calculated by Newton’s Law of Gravity and Einstein’s theory of General Relativity. 

In the second part of this essay we will use the theory to explain,

**1.** Human conscious experience of existence within gravitational fields.

**2.** The difference between a particle’s conscious experience of Gravity to that of a complex, macroscopic creature such as a human.

**3.** Special relativity, Relativistic Time and Space.

**4.** The Equivalence Principle, which underlies General relativity.

**5.** We will give the conscious scientific definition of the kilogram.

In a future essay I will explain how Intrinsic Consciousness can be used to finally reconcile General Relativity with Quantum Mechanics, to form a Physico-Conscious Theory of Quantum Gravity; The Postulate of Intrinsic Consciousness is the keystone of the Grand Unified Theory. 

Here is a link to a audio essay where I show how Intrinsic Consciousness gives the first simple, logical and intuitive explanation of all the experiments of Quantum Mechanics. The scientific mystery of Consciousness has been resoundingly solved!!!:

Meditation,"How can one begin the process of accepting their anxiety, instead of hiding away and trying to escape it?","I'm really sorry if this is the wrong place to post. But r/anxiety has not always proved overly helpful to me. I have pretty bad anxiety, and it has led to slight agoraphobia because I fight the anxiety. I try to escape and avoid it, and everything and any situation that brings it on. 

I have spent the past 2 hours reading about ""Accepting"" your anxiety. I will do this. I dont want to try, I WILL make sure it happens, no matter what. No medications, no coping strategies to make it easier to escape. I want to accept it, for everything it is. I want to live again, alongside it, if I must.

But how can I do this? Where do I begin? Whenever I feel anxiety, I combat it, I try my best to bury it away and hide from it. I evacuate places that make me feel it (Crowded and dense places) Which leads to its inevitable return, with more strength sometimes. Plus, I am bad for ruminating over it, an attempt to find insight on where it comes from, and how to prevent it. 

What are the steps to truly accepting anxiety, and moving on towards recovery? It sounds much easier said than done. I do not know HOW to do it. How do I ""Accept"" my anxiety, how do I stop fearing my anxiety?

Meditation,Grounding yourself,"If you are having trouble stilling your mind or grounding energy into your body, breathing etc... remember this mantra and follow it...

Meditation,My Experience ~90 Days of Consistent Meditation Post-Breakup (Never having practiced before),"**BACKGROUND:**

*Around 100 days ago, I was dumped by my girlfriend of \~2.5 years. Shit hurt and shit hurt even worse because I felt like I deserved to be dumped. I realized that I would have dumped me too. I was emotionally reactive, often angry, often intense, easily frustrated, and --  while always confident in myself -- genuinely dissatisfied with where I was in life. More than that, I was NEVER present. Always thinking about my career, my writing, my future. I existed in the mental equivalent of the stratosphere and thought only about my ""next steps."" I  never appreciated the present, and certainly never appreciated or took account of the state of of our relationship, which was lovely until I began to take it and her for granted. I didn't consider her enough. I wasn't mindful enough, then, I don't think. During the breakup, she told me she felt alone when she was with me and she was right to feel that way.  I was simply NEVER present. Combine that with being reactive (re: explosive especially in fights) and well, yeah, some Capital C Changes needed to be made. I've known on a deep level for years that I've needed meditation. It took some trauma to act as a catalyst for me to make the change, to build the habit, to begin to practice.* 

**I want to be as kind, compassionate, loving, empathetic, and mindful as possible. I never again want to make anyone that I'm with feel alone in my presence. So, in the absolute deepest depths of heartbreak (if you've been there, you know), I downloaded Headspace and got to work building a habit, building a practice. Each day, with very very very little exception, I get up, make my bed, sit at the end of it, and do a headspace guided meditation for at least 10 minutes, but more often 15-20. I'll often do a session in the middle of the day/before bed, too, depending on my schedule.**

**Here are some of the benefits/realizations I've had/noticed in the past 90-100 days:**

*1) A sense of awareness that frustration/anger/resistance is brewing (Sitting in traffic, in a long grocery line, while my boss or father is lecturing); I call those feelings the Evil Brew.*

*1A) The ability to CHOOSE not to go down the road toward the Evil Brew (frustration/anger/resistance)*

*1B) A sense of calm, peace, and pride stemming from the fact that I have recognized the Evil Brew and strayed away.*

*2) A genuine sense of awesome wonder at the roses. I'd never stopped to smell them before. When I'm outside on a walk or drive or whatever, I occasionally myself in happy, slack-jawed awe at the beauty of this life, of being privileged to be part of this world. It is a fleeting sensation but a stunning one. If you have ever taken any psychedelics, this is \~somewhat\~ similar to a peaceful afterglow, but more brief, mild, and organic. I hope this doesn't seem like Woo-Woo bullshit. It's real, at least for me.*

*3) The striking similarities between love and awareness. Both are always there and seem to be almost the same -- it's that ""Blue Sky"" feeling --  It's always there but it isn't until you look up at it that you realize how nice it is. This is a bit hard to articulate.* 

*4) The ability to handle racing thoughts/impulses. This is similar to straying away from the Evil Brew. Have you ever scrolled on social media/reddit/surfed the web for so long that the gears in your brain seem to gain friction and grind together? Then you get off because you've caught yourself then immediately get back on because your mind is racing and you're not really mindful of what you're doing? Yeah -- meditation has helped this.*

*5) Porn. Holy shit. I have not watched a single video since I started meditating, nor have even I had the desire. I watched my fair share of porn during quarantine and it CERTAINLY affected my sex life in the relationship. My sex life, post-breakup, has been incredible. It is a shame that it hasn't been with a partner that I've been in love with. But nonetheless, it has been incredible. This is extremely corny, but I feel like I'm making love as opposed to fucking?  I don't know. Porn ain't it.*

*6) Confidence through self-acceptance and self-love as opposed to confidence through comparison . I've always been a confident guy but this is a new brand of the whole thing. Rather than using other people as a benchmark to measure against, I'm confident because I love myself, love my life, and take pride in the fact that I'm actively working to be kinder, more compassionate, and more loving every day.*

*7) The universality/oneness of the human experience. I find myself more wanting to give time and energy to others. I want to make others feel good, feel happy.  I was/still am rather self-centered (aren't we all?) but I'm practicing on it, and I do believe that my practice is working.*

*8) The desire to sit still and be quiet. Reading was my method of quieting my mind before. Now, if I don't take time out to meditate, sit still and be quiet, I find myself craving it.*

*9) Forgiveness. Do you ever find yourself mentally self-flagellating? Whether you're whipping yourself for your words/actions/inactions or whipping others for theirs, it's not a clean feeling. It hurts. Meditation has helped me recognize when I am doing this. I can forgive myself, now.*

Before this, I had tried meditation but was unable/unmotivated to sit and be still for more than a minute. What a headcase I was. I realize I'm still a relative-rookie in this game and know I have a lot more to learn. I hope this isn't too promising/optimistic, but I do want to help catalyze someone to start a practice. It's helped me. 

**TL;DR: Got dumped, started meditating. It's helped.**

PS: There are plenty more benefits/realizations I've had but figured I'd get this out really quick. I really hope it helps. There are also many more things I've done to get through the swamp of this breakup -- most have to do with self-improvement. Please, please, please feel free to message me.

Meditation,I've been meditating for years; have plateaued - where should I go from here?,"Hi all. I've been doing this for awhile and reached a plateau, wondering where to go next. 

I started dabbling about 15 years ago, did a ten day vipassana course eight years ago, and nowadays averaging about 20-30 minutes every night. Occasionally I'll do a longer one like 45-50 minutes. 

Mainly I'm focusing on breathe, body scanning, and feeling the release of tension in my body, which is the best part. My mind has thoughts of course but nothing too crazy, no wild emotions or bad feelings. After 30 minutes it feels pretty good. 

So ***what's the next step***? I feel stagnant and unchallenged. Should I try a different focus or type of meditation? 

You might ask what are my goals: mainly to feel peace of mind and calm. I need to eat and drink less, I still have attachments to material desires and pleasure.

Meditation,extending meditation outside of sit down practice (dharana) by shifting focus from good/bad to there/not there,"something i find useful to help me maintain my meditative awareness is to avoid qualifying thigs as good or bad, which sounds unsafe but i can explain

its exokained in the scripture of the bhagavad gita that focusing instead of good or bad on there or not there leads to liberation from the shackles of needing to discern between good and bad

essentially regarding my surroundings with more honesty makes me more aafe than judging my surroundings based off of anything other than my personal archivl of data about how reality works even if its literally psychotic ie spiritual or metaphysical rather than what ppl say is realistic because in the wnd if the weird or otherworldly shit i perceive is persistent, at some point it comes a time to regard

because whats happening is if i have a thought and treat it as bad rather than regarding it as there, which is usually just me thinking of my self in someone elsea eyes as if that person has control over me rather than considering my own needs because i'm the one i'm most iintrinsically attached to, i submit to it and allow it to affect me by refusing to engage/pushing me out of my self

whereas if i for example i have lots of bad thoughts about peoples fashion choices, and instead of thinking wow i'm bad and these thoughts are bad creating a situation where my decision making is cut off from reality even though i literally made my decisions in reality, i can engage those thoughts with curiosity and compassion so they begin to become instead of an archive of seeming judgement an archive of whoa i had this crative idea based on someones outfit that i'm ashamed od because i imposed it on someone but its beautiful and i wanna document it and share with the workd my gift wow i'm so cute my voice is so delicate and considerate i must protect it with my honesty

ps my typos are meaningful to me so i leave them there , i think my meaning gets across to those who are willing

when i get used to the typical things i label bad about my self nd wnvironment to dismiss them i also get used to why i dismiss them which gives me more information on how to engage with them. thats data science, but we use it largely for profit. ar lwast that's proof it works lool. but for example i think of my self as lazy but now i also find new ways to interpret my laziness when i'm just like what dos this stillness mean to me rather than omg i sick for doing this, and  because i meditate a lot, i learned stuff like oh i am sad because my famiky doesnt engage with my creative ideas and i fewl alone. but look at me using this time to do something about it. then along thie line this feels familiar and wait ive been doing aomething about it by choosing art school to learn to express my self and getting  straight as. then a regression: painful but necessary, my creative ideas are valid despite my parents neglect and gaslighting. 

suddenly my parents withdraw support to my access to my education. this is expected now. i cultivate the articularion for my self to admit privately that i'm scared i'm just making rhings up, i dont need their support to find actually everyone deserves to be loved by their parents, the definition of parental neglect is experientially validating based on my labeling ans active silencing

so fuck i'm at war do i report my parents with five reported claims of incapability to discern reality or do i basically submit and just go homeless to exape??  well first theres no good and bad but what there must be is evidence. so i squint to find the ecidence and only respond to the evidence and suddenly my parents are fumbling and bumbling and my paychosis and reality are getting confused and they can't decide anymore so fuck  just get the bitch a weed card, which helps me persist withour fear and focus on withholding my creative ideas to my self to avoid the sikencing while still nurturing them so i can be energized to separately tackle th abuse

the other night a shaman hit my dms, validated my art and some of my visions, and said he would take some time to get back to me

all that to say focusing on there vs not rather than good vs not has been a soiritual journey

Meditation,"""How Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi changed my life"" - Gary Weber","&gt;When I was in graduate school working on my Ph.D. in the physical sciences, I had an insight. I saw the great turmoil, unhappiness, stress, and confusion caused by the internal narrative, the “blah, blah”, that was never-ending and useless. I decided to see if I could end it, and free myself from its grasp. As I was raised as a devout fundamental Christian in the Pennsylvania Appalachian coal fields, there was no “reason” why I would have even imagined this was possible.

&gt;I began looking everywhere, and reading a Zen poem, a profound awakening experience happened, and then went away. However, during that experience, I saw that there were no thoughts, no suffering, and a totally different and more “true” reality, than my “everyday” reality. Then I began meditating in this Zen tradition and found the work of Bassui, a 14th century Zen monk, whose process was asking “What is my own mind?”, “What is it that hears this sound?”, “What moves this hand?”, etc. Soon, a book manifested from a California yoga teacher who talked about “Ramana Maharshi”, and his questions, which were very similar, but much more accessible, detailed and documented.

&gt;Investigating, I found that Ramana Maharshi lived while I was alive, was in videos, on BBC, in Life Magazine, his last pictures were by Henry Cartier Bresson, and Carl Jung had written the foreword for a book covering years of direct meetings with many, many seekers. It was clear that he was highly regarded and trusted. I got the pamphlet “Who Am I?” of Ramana Maharshi’s first written teachings. It was a constant companion for years, along with other compilations. Every day, with a 50 to 60 hr/wk job with much responsibility and travel, a wife and two children, I woke at 4 or 5 am, did an hour of yoga and then an hour of self-inquiry, typically “Where am I?”, or “Who hears?” before going to work. I also asked these questions throughout my workday when getting a cup of tea, or every odd numbered hour, for a few minutes. As attachments were recognised as a major obstacle, Shankara’s Nirvana Shatakam manifested from an unexpected source.

&gt;I looked at every possible category and felt into it to see if there was attachment, and if there was, asked “What has this attachment?” I also read about hunting down the “I”, so I would feel my way into what it was that was watching the contents of the mind, and carefully explore to see if I could find its root or location. After about 25 years and 20,000 hrs of practice, I deeply, fully, totally surrendered everything, every attachment, every possession, even my life, to Bhagavan so that I might know the Truth. Within a few days, coming down from a yoga posture I had done many times before, everything stopped…fears, desires, thoughts and the illusion of control and free will. As there was no “I”, there was nothing to hold the “other end” of these, and never had been. It was clear, as Bhagavan had said that nothing, not even the smallest event was being done by “me”, but that all that occurred was happening through this empty shell of a vehicle, as the Universe/Bhagavan danced it. At the time I had about 1,000 scientists and engineers, four research laboratories, and about a $250MM budget so I wondered how it would be able to do my job.

&gt;When I went to work, no one even noticed. I found that I was more efficient, creative, and present in meetings and with others. Surprisingly, “my life” went along better without “me” in it. Something was running my life that was more intelligent, powerful and more connected with “the world” than I was, as “it” could arrange amazing serendipitous events with people I could never have imagined I would get to know, including several billionaires. After a few months, I left my job, and went to India to study with one of the most famous yoga teachers. Then on to Tiruvannamalai, staying at Ramanasramam, and going to many famous places particularly the Old Hall, Virupaksha cave and Skandashram, and doing Giripradakshina.

&gt;I even went down to the Pathala Lingam in the Arunachaleswar temple where Ramana had sat, and watched a complete ceremony in the inner chamber of the temple with only my guide and the priests in attendance. The first night, I looked up at the hill from my room, and there were fires all over Arunachala. For about four years, I told very few people what had happened, but then was gradually drawn back into research and business management in very responsible positions, and into leading a small Zen group, and then giving workshops. Soon a book, “Happiness Beyond Thought: A Practical Guide to Awakening” manifested, strongly based on Bhagavan’s teachings, including the entirety of Upadesa Saram, Nirvana Shatakam, and some of Bhagavan’s recommended verses from the Bhagavad Gita. This book was dedicated to Ramana (who wrote the book) with his famous picture sitting cross legged facing the camera with the caption “Dedicated to Ramana Maharshi who found me lost and wandering in a dark forest, taught me what inquiry, love and surrender were and brought nobody home.”

&gt;Subsequently, folks began hearing about this unusual state of natural, persistent, “no thoughts” that had manifested, and I was invited to participate in a Ph.D. thesis on “persistent non-duality”, in which of the 36 selected in the study out of 500 candidates, this state was the “best”. This led to an fMRI study at Yale on experienced (roughly 10,000 hrs) meditators, who were primarily Theravadan Buddhists doing Theravada practices, in which of the 100 studied, “my” state was the “most present” and totally unique. This state was, as Bhagavan had said it must be, “sahaj” or “natural”, as it was always there without any “doing”. This was covered in a Psychology Tomorrow article, “The Neuroscience of Suffering: And Its End” at https://jeffwarren.org/articles/neuroscienceofsuffering/.

&gt;Without any “doer”, videos, presentations, a website, a blog, another book “Dancing Beyond Thought: Bhagavad Gita Verses and Dialogues on Awaken” based on Bhagavan’s selection of Bhagavad Gita verses, manifested. As Bhagavan had also written this book, it was dedicated to him with the same picture and caption used in the previous book. All of my work is free in some format, as it is He who makes all this happen. This realisation has made an enormous difference in all my work. In my most recent trip to Ramanasramam, I was drawn to the Old Hall, and Virupaksha Cave. In the Old Hall, there was a direct, and totally unexpected, unmistakable message from Bhagavan. The woman sitting next to me told me later than I had “disappeared”. In Virupaksha Cave, I was held “captive”, virtually frozen in the right hand corner for four hours while enormous energy poured out of the area around the altar and flowed with great force into “me”.

&gt;There was no message, vision, story, blinding light, etc., just the sense of a great download being installed. After four hours, it stopped as suddenly as it had arisen, and “I was free to go”. Despite great initial resistance to Sanskrit and chanting, I now chant many verses from the Bhagavad Gita, Ribhu Gita, Upadesa Saram, Nirvana Shatakam, and the Gayatri (with mudras), each day, and teach them to others. Serendipitously, a deep bhakti practice also emerged. As I was primarily a “jnana” practitioner, I was not drawn to it naturally, but soon Bhagavan, Shiva, Dakshinamurti, and Arunachala were the objects of a bhakti practice involving the Gayatri mantra and mudras. This practice moved from “tasting the sugar”, to “being the sugar”, and was very valuable. I now communicate with folks all over the world with Bhagavan’s message, in many different formats and venues. Many days, all that can be done is to just bow down and sometimes cry, that I was so fortunate as to have been found by Bhagavan. It is difficult to imagine what life would have been like had he not shown his Grace on this humble pilgrim.

Meditation,Changing methods mid-meditation?,"Hi, I'm pretty new to all this, and I'm pretty happy with my results so far (as small as I feel they are, they're still something!) But I had a quick question.

I started with 5 minute sessions, then slowly increased sessions by one minute every few days. I reached 15 minutes and have stayed there cause that feels like a good amount of time for a beginner like me. 

My question is, I find myself switching techniques during my session. Is this okay? Or is it better to practice one method the entire session? For example, maybe the first 5ish minutes I'll do mindful breathing. Then I'll switch to alternate nostril breathing. Then maybe even switch a third time to a body scan, or even the third eye practice. During the 5 to 10 minute meditations, this wasn't much of an issue, due to the session being over by the time I got ""bored"". 

Is this okay? I figure it's not *bad* because I'm still meditating. But I feel I could be something to avoid. Maybe practicing patience and sticking to one method the entire 15 minutes is better.

Meditation,How ironic… one of the most “productive” things you can do with your life is regularly sitting and doing absolutely nothing.,"Of course, everyone has a different definition of what it means to be productive. For me, it’s being able to put 100% of my attention and awareness into whatever I’m doing (whether it’s work, hanging out with friends, watching a movie, or playing a sport).

Before I started meditating, I’d take a break from one activity by doing another. But the truth is all activities require a certain level of awareness to participate in, even the ones we do for fun.

I was never giving the attention and awareness part of my brain a rest. So even though I went from work to watching a movie, I would never really pay attention to the movie and would just be cycling through distractions on my phone. And somehow still feel mentally drained afterwards.

Now that I meditate and sit still for 10-20min daily, it resets my brain so that I can be fully present in whatever I’m doing.",True,0,1639958811,2021-12-20 08:06:51,,,blazerman345,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/rk9kbi/how_ironic_one_of_the_most_productive_things_you/,1,1.0,ironic one productive thing life regularly sit absolutely nothing course everyone different definition mean productive able put 100 attention awareness whatever whether work hang friend watch movie play sport start id take break one activity another truth activity require certain level awareness participate even one fun never give attention awareness part brain rest even though go work watch movie never really pay attention movie cycle distraction phone somehow still feel mentally drain afterwards sit still 1020min daily reset brain fully present whatever,73,22,0,0,6

Meditation,Hello! I would like to share my experience so far and would love some insights as well!,"So I’ve started meditation about a year ago. I really didn’t know what I was doing, but I did it since the meditation is about “attracting love” and at the time I saw the comments saying how they’ve attracted the love of their life, because of that 30 day meditation challenge. I couldn’t entirely remember anything in specific but I do remember being very “calm” and normal, nothing too crazy. Then I stopped.

Last March- April I’ve experienced so many challenges that affected my mental health in a negative way. For the first time ever I’ve experienced panic attacks, had so much anxiety, constantly negative, constantly down, was the worst person to talk to, i was angry, jealous, bitter, resentful, paranoid about everything and my mind was just in a terrible state. I tried meditation during those times but it didn’t helped at all, in fact it made it worst cause I my negative thoughts just got louder. Then recently I came to find out that you shouldn’t really meditate during times of stress, if you are stressed out the best thing you can do for yourself is to move instead of sit down with your thoughts, thought I’d share that.

Recently I was talking to my therapist about my attention problem, I told her about my struggles with focus, I get easily distracted, I rarely get productive, and I waste my time by laying down in bed overthinking and going through social media comparing myself to others and making myself miserable.

Then she suggested that I try mindfulness, at first I didn’t really care for it and instantly thought to myself that if I did try maybe I’ll get distracted again and forget to do it.

I’m glad I did, today is my 10th day of mindfulness, and my 8th day of meditating, my life has completely changed. It’s not easily noticeable I have to honest, but seeing how I was a month before vs now, a lot has changed. I kid you not, I thought I’m forever gonna be unproductive, easily distracted and would never accomplish anything cause of my attention span, but now I’ve done so much in the past week and it’s all because I started meditation and mindfulness. The benefits are there, and I swear I’m in a much better place. I’m more present, if my mind starts to wander I immediately snap myself back to reality and I don’t get lost in a thought. Haven’t been negative this past 10 days which is new to me, if I do thought of something unpleasant it wouldn’t ruin my day, it would bother me for a few minutes but then it’s like back to the normal again (aka good state).

I know it’s a long post but I highly recommend this to everyone and I also posted this as a reminder to myself to keep going. We can all do this! I swear let’s all lead ourselves to a better path, where we can all be present.

I really hope you guys continue or start being mindful or do meditation because it can definitely change your life for the better. Goodluck!❤️

I like to lay in my bed, don’t move at all but keep awake and and reprogram my brain in a positive way i like to call it. I usually feel better afterwards but today something disturbing happened. I saw inside a small apartment, a young girl with blonde shoulder length hair with a red dress was in the living room, she was awake but she looked like she was drugged? I saw that she was confused and scared but she couldn’t even stand up without falling back to couch. And then there was a man in the kitchen which was another room but connected to the living room. He was washing something on the sink and there was a body of another man on the floor of the kitchen. I was very confused and disturbed and i didn’t even remembered i was meditating i was just looking at the girl and the men. When I remembered that i was meditating and asked myself wth is this I suddenly felt like i am being pulled back but then i was filled with overwhelming feeling of helping her. I kept telling myself i need to help her. Remember i am still not moving in bed when those are happening in my mind. Then i felt like i was fighting something like i just wanted to help her so somehow. Then i found myself inside a house. The house looked abandoned and dark. there was nothing, i was facing a stairway to downstair and a dark corner and and a room that i couldn’t see inside because it was dark. I felt like i wasn’t alone and again i forgot that i was actually in bed meditating.

Meditation,"I tried everything, anti-depressants, Neuro Emotional Technique...","If you had told me 5 years ago I would be getting up at 5:30 to meditate every day and that I would become a children's author to introduce kids to meditation, I would've laughed and asked how many tequilas you had.

As a stressed-out environmental lawyer with a new baby. I had no idea about what was going to come my way in the next year.

Post-natal depression, vestibular migraines (the ones that make you constantly dizzy) -- I had everything I should be happy (the supportive husband, a healthy baby, a lucrative job) and I was miserable.

I tried everything, anti-depressants, Neuro Emotional Technique, essential oils, and all sorts of natural remedies and in the end, it was practicing meditation that brought me back to my center.

It has made me calmer, more patient at home, less irritable, and overall a nicer person (when you stop being angry with yourself, you stop being angry with others).

I learned to understand my emotions, the why of how I feel a certain way in any given moment and it has given me the certainty that regardless of what happens I will be ok.

Because as Thoreau said, things don't change, we are the ones who change.

I saw so many benefits in myself that I knew I had to teach this to my son. So I wrote him a story, just like his other bedtime stories but this one happens to talk about a magic door inside his head, a journey inwards and manifestation.

Meditation,How 60 days of morning meditation changed my day,"I was introduced to mindfulness when I started therapy back in college 5 years ago. Since then I’ve tried a lot of different types of meditation. Then I found yoga which breathing techniques (pranayama) is a huge part of it. 

I was going through a very difficult phase of my life few months ago (ie. Relocation and quarter life crisis). I decided to commit to meditation every morning, even just for 5 minutes. 

I create a sequence of habit - when my alarm goes off, I wake up, brush my teeth, water my plants then sit down to meditate for at least 5 minutes using “Insight Timer”. (I also have headspace subscription but I find the guided meditations are pretty repetitive)

It has been 60 days since I started this and I feel really good. The app has a mood checkin feature and I’ve noticed my mood went from “bad” and “awful” to occasionally “okay”. Now it’s mostly “good” and “great”.


Of course there were days that sucked but at least my day wouldn’t be derailed by one single incident or I spiraled less. Whenever I feel overwhelmed I just tell myself “ok I can do a quick breathing exercise for 5 mins now” and that helps a lot. 

I wouldn’t say this mood change is entirely due to meditation because I still see a therapist and practice yoga, but it helps to start my day better. 

I highly encourage you try it, even just for 2-3 minutes before you start your day (and don’t go to social media immediately) 🤍",True,0,1639903432,2021-12-19 16:43:52,,,Imaginary-Art-8944,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/rjsovk/how_60_days_of_morning_meditation_changed_my_day/,1,1.0,60 day morning change day introduce mindfulness start therapy back college 5 year ago try lot different type find breathe technique pranayama huge part go difficult phase life month ago ie relocation quarter life crisis decide commit every morning even 5 minute create sequence habit alarm go wake brush teeth water plant sit least 5 minute use insight timer headspace subscription find guide pretty repetitive 60 day start feel really good app mood checkin feature notice mood go bad awful occasionally okay mostly good great course day suck least day wouldnt derail one single incident spiral le whenever feel overwhelm tell ok quick breathe exercise 5 min help lot wouldnt say mood change entirely due still see therapist practice help start day better highly encourage try even 23 minute start day go social medium immediately,90,29,0,6,18

Meditation,Anxiety after meditation,"Hello everyone,

I would like to ask a problem that i am facing nowadays after my meditation sessions.

I started meditating a few years ago, i have had ups and downs with my meditation but later I was able to increase my concentration over the time.

Nowadays I can meditate quite a bit (compared to my past of course)

When I am meditating, i get usual benefits , like being care free, very happy, and I quite enjoy it. 

The problem is, when I stop meditating, and continue my regular life, everything started to look quite unnecessary, and I feel like there is no need to hassle with the current life I am in. Every task that I was forcing my brain to solve (im an engineer in one of high tech company btw) seems to worth nothing. 

And this makes me anxious quite a lot. I cant continue keeping my calmness during the time i am not meditating. 

Everything we make, in the work, or in society seems to be wrong, and it makes me feel like dropping everything and live in the woods or something (literally).

And it is a problem for me right now.

Have any of you had similar experiences and found a technique or solution for it?",True,0,1639880008,2021-12-19 10:13:28,,,juynb78,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/rjmeh9/anxiety_after_meditation/,2,1.0,anxiety hello everyone ask problem face nowadays session start year ago later able increase concentration time nowadays quite bite compare past course usual benefit care free happy quite enjoy problem stop continue regular life everything start look quite unnecessary feel need hassle current life every task force brain solve engineer one high tech company btw seem worth nothing make anxious quite lot continue keep calmness time everything make work society seem wrong make feel drop everything live wood something literally problem right similar experience find technique solution,94,29,0,0,11

Meditation,Can Meditation Help Me Recover Faster From a Concussion? Does Anyone Here Have a Success Story? Please Advise Me.,"A month ago, I had a blow to my forehead.


The next day, I felt nauseous, weak in my left hand, dizzy, confused, and had a heavy head.


In the same week, I consulted a neurologist, and after looking at the CT scan of my brain as well at its report, he said that I am completely normal and my brain has not suffered any damage at all.


However, a month later since the incident, I feel the headache return whenever I walk for around 20 minutes. This worries me a bit, and I will be meeting the same doctor again in a few days.


In the meantime, I noticed that meditating for about an hour centered me and nullified the lingering symptoms in my head and my mind. The day before yesterday, I was unable to sleep no matter how hard I tried, but a deep-breathing exercise solved the issue within 30 minutes.


This gave me a flicker of hope that I can gradually return to normalcy one day and be able to exercise like I normally do. My mother is constantly telling me to not worry or fear too much because thinking negatively will only make it harder for me to recuperate.


Now, I read stories of people who had suffered far more severe shocks to their heads, to the point that they forget many things about their lives. I, on the other hand, currently remember every person and every event in my life, so I don't think I am going to forget anything about myself. Also, one month may be too short of a time to recover completely, so I may be overthinking this.


All that being said, has any one of you in this Sub experienced something similar, and has meditation been a major tool in your path to recovery?

Meditation,"Meditating has not yet been enough for suicidal thoughts and mental health, does anyone have suggestions?","I am in a pretty poor life situation. To sum it up, I have very serious health conditions- ADHD, PMDD, causing depression, suicidal feelings and severe anxiety 24/7. Because of my impairment, I am struggling to keep a low paying job, possibly getting a higher paying job, but I always have to move on because my impairment with memory, executive function, organization, etc. is so, so bad that I literally cannot do the work required of me well enough. I have lost my  health insurance. I cannot afford health insurance. And if I did get it, my new psychiatrist will not prescribe me ADHD medication now.

I feel so trapped. I've been trying to meditate, and sometimes it helps a little, but it is just not enough. Living is so incredibly hard and painful for me. If people didn't love me, I would absolutely kill myself. It is only to not hurt others that I keep trying.

Is there a certain type of meditation that could be especially helpful? So far I have been going through the waking up course. I got to about meditation 10, when I started having issues doing it at all, because of how much stress I have, I completely get lost in thought sometimes for almost the entire meditation.

Please, any advice at all. I am so desparate. Even advice on how to accept the reality that may be things like poverty, losing my car if I lose my job, etc...the problem is, I am so anxious, along with my ADHD, that I just cannot get enough tasks done to even begin to get out of this hole.

Meditation,What to do with anxiety?,"Imagine you worry because you are afraid to lose your job,

to lose your close one in relationships, to lose at all, meaning the death of your close one,

imaging you are afraid because you won't be able to find a new job,

to build new relationships.

Imagine you were a sportsman and your career is over. You got trauma or just the time has come.

For you, it's a tragedy (even if you are popular and everyone is praising you) - what I'm going to do now? Am I, is my life is over?

So what are the ways to address worries and fears?

Because practicing observing thoughts, not engaging with them, and letting them go will not be long enough:

You should come in peace somehow with your worries, fears, doubts.

The first mental exercise is to accept the worst option. I will become useless. I will lose this in my life or that person in my life.

Somehow during ups and downs in our lives, we have survived and continue to live.

This means somehow you will adapt even to the worst situation. Your ability to cope with your life now and in previous times will help you with that.

The second mental exercise is prevention. You think and realize how to mitigate the worst-case scenario. One of the examples of reflection:

The answer for job joss can be this - it is learning. You are learning to be able to do not just one thing. You are learning because it is fun and prolongs life. Gives you the ability to care and provide more for your close ones. And if you are learning today you will be 100% confident you won't become useless in the future.

If it is the loss of a person:

You can mitigate this by spending more aware and joyful time with this person, or your pet, etc.

Noone gives life hours for granted. Anyone from us can be unplugged at once. How many stories about dying young sportsmen

at the field with heartbreaks you have heard?

When you start to live your life like it is the last day:

It does not mean you are allowed to do everything - like stealing, cheating, killing, etc. It means that you focus only on the most important.

Will you have time to worry about the future? You will have to worry about now. You won't worry at all.

And this is true the more in this day you do to learn, to love, to experience, to fill the more fulfilled and less worried life is.

I show modern meditation techniques over here, which also helps with anxiety and no need to sit in lotus posture -&gt;

Meditation,Has anyone ever had the enlightenment experience in a dream?,"I've been meditating a lot lately, ""seeking the path"" (whatever that means), and learning more about myself (whatever that means) and getting more in touch with whatever.

Without going into too much detail, I had an epiphany recently that shook me to my core and changed my entire concept of reality. I started feeling a lot of internal resistance (fear, loathing, terror) during meditation, but instead of running from it, for the first time in my life I instead ran towards it. I ran into the ""don't want, please stop"" feeling and it instantly transformed into pure bliss. 

This of course, given Buddhist philosophy, makes perfect sense. In the doctrine of mutual arising it is explained that pain and pleasure are one. We seek pleasure and avoid pain because we fail to understand that they are intricately connected. So of course in just the same way that experiencing pleasure could lead to bliss, why would experiencing pain be any different? They're the same thing.

And when I realized that seeking anxiety/suffering could be so pleasurable, I then began to seek that as well. 

But I had a dream last night that should have been a nightmare. Or, that is to say, I've been haunted by nightmares throughout my life. And in the most horrifying, brutal nightmares, there's this extreme impulse inside of you to escape because it feels like you are going to die. 

But I realize now that this fear of death was not a fear of physical death, but the death of myself, and instead of running from it, I yet again embraced it, and in the dream, I became God.

Here are some somatic approaches for releasing anger, frustration, tension and rage stuck in the body. 

When we deny ourselves a healthy form of expression of these emotions, their energetic imprint clogs our system, causing major blockages and stagnancy in our lives. Worse, they can manifest as physical ailments if not properly addressed. Tune in to learn about practical embodiment practices to release this energy so you can move forward with experiences and your life!

Meditation,The rescued cat and meditation,"We rescued a cat a couple months ago. She was hanging outside our house and was starved and dehydrated and flea infested. We took her in, got her to the vet, and now she's doing very fine now and is part of the family.  


I meditate in the mornings before starting my day for at least 30-45 minutes. I usually close the door to my office and do my sit.  


Once kitty started feeling better, she would be outside scratching at the door and sticking her nose under the door and meowing at me. I figure she was saying, ""Hey, hey, in there, I'm hungry. Time for 'The Stinky' (what we call the cat food because OMG it stinks!)"". So, I would just let her be and feed her after I was done.  


One morning, I decided to leave the door open.  


She comes in. Comes up to me and headbutts my hands then rubs on them a few times. Then climbs into my lap and lays down!  


She purrs and I focus on my task at hand and surprisingly she stays there the whole time. We are like one purring meditating machine. I believe even our breathing synced up.  


Now, I leave the door open every morning and without fail she comes in headbutts my hands a few times and then lays in my lap for the entire time. I would be lying to say this isn't wonderful and I don't enjoy her being there!  


I saw an image on my Facebook timeline that said the following:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Cats have the ability to meditate. One may notice that when started a meditation, your cat will be even more attracted and will join in alongside you. Ancient Buddhists document meditation techniques with their cats and the results are remarkable.""

Meditation,White Light Meditation.,"So, I just come across something I didn't know had a name. To overcome addiction, I started meditating. I was going through a horrible time with doubt, shame, and anxiety, and at first, I started experiencing this small white ball of light when I would pray or meditate. It gave me hope. I attributed this hope to my success on getting clean from a horrible addiction and the more I read about it the more it makes sense. Engaging with this white light helps you to become aware of the genuine nature of your spirit, soul, and inner self. It is part of your body's natural healing capacity and improves one's overall sense of well-being.  It helps to absorb all your negative emotions, attachments, feelings of anxiety, and stress. Being in deep despair and first seeing this white light led me to one of the most powerful meditations I have had to date. I was just letting my mind drift when I felt as though I was in a boat in the middle of a dark ocean. All alone and lost just floating at the currents will. Then I see the white light. I interpreted it as a light house that was there to guide me. It was bigger this time and again brought me hope. The next time I experienced it I was setting below it and it was illuminating my path. I felt as though I had made it out of the ocean of despair and was now grounded and the light would show me the way. I put my trust in this over 3 years ago and didn't turn back. Today I am over a year sober and have graduated college, ready to start my career in drug abuse counseling. This light helped me find myself and gave me hope when I had nothing. TIL of white light meditation.

Meditation,Has the vaccine affected your ability to reach inner peace?,"I am asking this because I have found myself in a situation where I really need some reassuring responses. The thing is that I am experiencing great difficulties at the moment to reach a peace of mind, and I find myself stuck in the world of thoughts. I am not an anti-vaxxer and generally don't get caught in fear based ideas and beliefs, and truly I do believe this is my own mind playing. But I would really like some input from you guys on the subject.

I got my first (and only) shot in June and the same night I had severe reactions like muscle tensions and racing heart. This led me to experience severe anxiety that just kept increasing. The last 1,5 years I have been advancing more and more in my meditation practices, and I my experience is that when anxiety arises it disappears when I am facing it, and I reach a state of inner peace. This night this didn't happen and I got more and more anxious and paniced. Eventually it was gone, but it was a scary experience and I believe this experience induced this fear in me that has been growing.

Since then I have been able to reach inner peace and blissful states from time to time, but I have been quite in the dark because of personal traumas related to a breakup. I do believe this is the reason for my current state and struggles, but this fear of the vaccine being the cause is still there. Last night I stumbled upon some thread on Reddit where people where discussing that the vaccine cuts the connection between the body and the higher Self, and this made me even more scared. I know deep down this is BS and this is not even a possibility but I can't help feeling anxious about the small chance of this being true.

I just want to come back to my own Self, with this blissful energy in the background. Right now I am extremely tired, stressed, have racing thoughts, have a hard time concentrating and would even consider myself depressed. I also have some weird tingling sensation in my throat since 1,5-2 months back that my mind has made a connection to the vaccine. At the same time I do know how much our minds can play tricks on us, and that fear itself is the greatest obstacle to inner peace.

And of course, if there is a subconscious fear that the vaccine has caused this, it will become a self fulfilling prophecy. This is the reason I'm reaching out to you guys, to hopefully get some reassuring responses regarding my concerns.",True,0,1639655136,2021-12-16 19:45:36,,,holyredbeard,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/rhp3dx/has_the_vaccine_affected_your_ability_to_reach/,1,1.0,vaccine affect ability reach inner peace ask find situation really need reassure response thing experience great difficulty moment reach peace mind find stick world thought antivaxxer generally catch fear base idea belief truly believe mind play really input guy subject first shoot june night severe reaction muscle tension race heart lead experience severe anxiety keep increase last 15 year advance practice experience anxiety arise disappear face reach state inner peace night didnt happen anxious panic eventually go scary experience believe experience induce fear grow able reach inner peace blissful state time time quite dark personal trauma relate breakup believe reason current state struggle fear vaccine cause still last night stumble upon thread reddit people discus vaccine cut connection body higher self make even scar know deep b even possibility help feel anxious small chance true want come back self blissful energy background right extremely tire stress race thought hard time concentrate even consider depress weird tingle sensation throat 152 month back mind make connection vaccine time know much mind play trick u fear greatest obstacle inner peace course subconscious fear vaccine cause become self fulfil prophecy reason reach guy hopefully reassure response regard concern,219,46,0,0,27

Meditation,"What is this practice that I resonate with so much? I'd like to learn more and get ""better"", butI don't know what the thing I am doing is called.","Hello all,  
I struggle to practice mindfulness meditation, but get a lot out of this other thing I do. I'd like to better understand it, but internet searches come up empty because I don't have the right words. What I do:

I sit comfortably, close my eyes, take a few deep breathes, and ask myself, ""where am I at right now"". If nothing comes immediately, I ask myself until something appears. Usually when I do this I am feeling anxious and overwhelmed and where I find myself is in a field, flying my kite. When actually flying my kite, I am just in my body and the flood of thoughts fade away, and only the tugging of the strings, the sound of the wind, the feeling of the grass, and the content joy of the action is present. By reliving and tapping into this, I calm and ground myself into the moment, into my body, and into myself. Usually a cellar door appears in the field, and I open it and climb down and down. At some point, I  reach a spherical room within which are cushions and a fireplace, perhaps also hot chocolate, a book, boardgame. Comfortable, safe, healing, womb-like. One time another door appeared which I knew would lead me deeper, but I chose not to go down. My state coming out of this ""meditation"" is calm, grounded, and peaceful. It has also offered me insights into why I might be feeling anxious in that moment and other opportunities for reflection and growth.

Another time, I discovered my feet were attached to invisible roots that i followed deep into the soil and upon reaching earth's core, my view shifted to space, and I was seeing all the ""roots"" of all living beings, plus the oceans and mountains and forests connecting to all others through the heart of the planet.

Anyway, thanks to anyone who read through that. I would love to learn more about this thing that I, and I'm sure others, do. I've really struggled this past year and feel potential healing in developing this practice. Any sort of leads would be most welcome.

Meditation,My first emotional meditation,"i recently decided to make the decision to work on myself. that includes working on my self concept, my physical body, my emotions, and establishing a healthy amount of self discipline. after a long day of working out, redirecting my negative thoughts to more powerful ones, and learning how to enjoy my own presence... i decided to sit down for a meditation session.

i'm not new to meditation and i've been doing it for quite some time now, but i've never cried during one like i did just now.

during my meditation, i remembered a yt discussion video i watched about conscious thinking, and during it they talked about there being a higher version of ourselves protecting us and that reaching out to them during meditation will help.

so i did just that. 

a few minutes into the meditation i reached out and called upon this higher self.

i don't keep track of the time during this all so idk when but sometime after i was visualizing a scenario with someone i love. it was a happy one and it immediately made me cry.

but i persisted with the meditation.

after some time i got another visualization of what was me patting another me on the back and saying ""you're safe now""... instant waterworks... as expected.

i was crying so much that i had to stop. i felt so safe within myself. everything i had went through in the past didn't seem to matter because in that moment i felt safe.

Meditation,Practising regularly but I can’t be in it.,"So, for the last couple of months, even though I’ve been practising meditation regularly, (1-2 sessions of 10-20 mins every day, and I’ve been doing this for the entire year missing on an average 1 day a month) I am not able to be in it.

Meditation,"Past Relationship, Traumatic Moments, Enlightenment","Hello everyone. Recently I've broke up with my long-term relationship girlfriend.

I don't know where to start.

My life was nothing but a full cycles of suffering since I was a teenager (probably since I was 12-13 years old). For my whole Iife I considered suicide many times (and tried once, nearly died), hurted myself physically and emotionally and there seems to be no stop.

You see, my last relationship with a woman was kind of special, she was nothing but a kind, loving and compassionate person to me, even when I felt abosulety destroyed, she still loved me and supported me in many ways. She wanted to stay with me no matter what.

I couldn't believe what I found. This one one of the happiest moments in my whole life.


Now I understand that I didn't deserve to recieve that love. We broke up because I was a real monster in relationship. I was very destructive towards her and brought only pain while she gave me everything else. I beated her, blamed her for nothing,  was very destructive and nervous etc etc. You could imagine.


 I seem to be destroy every relationship with people by my own, I'm very agressive inside, I couldn't enjoy the present moment when I was  with her nor couldn't accept my life... I think I became evil.

I always live in the past, constantly relieving the traumatic moments, and it was the same when I was with her. 

A  few days ago I've discovered Alan Watts, Ekhart Tolle, and Ram Dash. 

It's painful to admit, but I'm the creator of all suffering in my life, sure there were a lot of people who hurted me (including family) when I grew up, but now I'm 27 and I see that world that I live in is nothing but a reflection of my vicious mind. 

You see, after this experience I'm moved. It completely changed my perspective. If before I was really angry towards this world and people around, now I see myself as one who is responsible for the creating of all this pain. And my recent relationship is another proof for this.

After break up I made a hard decision. I live in full solitude, I don't want to contact other people nor I want to have anything with my past life.

I want to start from a blank page. I started to do a lot of good things - eating properly (without meat), working out a lot, working and making money. I study a new profession... And I never quit.

This are massive changes for me, I've never was so dedicated to change myself and everything works good so far in my practical life.

But still, my mind is suffering, I suffer. I feel guilt for ruining my relationship. Last few weeks I cried a lot because I realized who I really was. And what I had. 

How do I say that ... I want to develop further, spirituality, because I received love I want to give love. That kind of person I'm now will never have a good relationship with people and this world. Nor I will appreciate them or my life.

And because my instinct for survival is a lot weaker than my desire to quit (I killed myself after all, and contemplated on it many times, and easily could it again)... I came to particular point of view from which I see my every decision now ... It's either for me 

1. I will change and transform completely.

2. I die.

And to be honest, this works. I'm less afraid to do something and move more radically, because I have no illusion that other people have that life will be infinite nor that it will be comfortable as it is.

Don't get me wrong, I'm writing this because I want to recieve some support and see if I'm not alone (because I'm a lonely person).

Ekhart Tolle, Alan Watts and Ram Dash opened my eyes on my nature and why I suffer, but my mind seems to resist further reading. When I read them, sometimes I'm in shock because I see how everything they're saying is truth...

But because of my emotions, it's hard for me to develop furher. Maybe I'm in rush. I already trying to notice my every thought and emotion, but it's hard... The more I look inside myself the more I'm anxious ... Because I have a very monstrous mind and now I notice what's going there.  I didn't notice before and it was easier to blame everyone else.

Please, tell me, how do I develop further? Should I look for some support or possibly a teacher?

Meditation,How to deal with overflow of sexual energy,"I am fairly new to meditating, I don't really know any particular types of doing it, Ive always worked with my breath and did body scans, which has helped me to bring me back in the moment and be more aware. Lately, since Ive stopped using masturbation as a coping mechanism (took me a while to understand that), Its been getting more and more difficult to meditate, to listen to my body and to focus on my body. My mind then is like dozens of pop up windows, random images or phantasies of something sexual show up constantly, making it difficult to focus. I read a few things here, people talking about turning that sexual energy into something else, into other energies. If someone here has a few things they might know about this topic, I would really appreciate any help or guidance on this topic. Sometimes it gets frustrating, it feels like it won't stop coming and that suppressing it makes matters worse. I don't mean suppressing as if sexual energy is something bad, don't get me wrong. But I feel like I have a not so healthy relationship with this, especially masturbation. I don't want to feel like it has full control over me

Meditation,Task failed successfully,"Lately I've been exploring my feelings following the order of the energy centers (bottom up, starting with fear). I've also been reading the book ""Think like a monk"" were the author talks about how the mind tries to avoid fear and that you have to wait for a while to discover your true feelings.

My initial thought was ""I'm not afraid of too many things"" but as I kept digging during my meditation session I tried to do as the author said and recalled a situation that was really terryfing to me. To give a bit of context, it was when me and my gf at the time got robbed on a lonely beach by some guys (luckily we got away safe and sound, but still scary). I remembered the feeling of fear through my body and following the book suggestions I kept asking myself ""what i'm really afraid of?"", and my conclussion was that my biggest fear was not being able to protect my gf and that even today I feel a little anxious when for whatever reason other people could rely on me for protection.

So here is where I hit a dead end, because that experience still gives me anxiety from time to time but not too often enough to be a tought that is always there. The book said something along the lines of analyzing where the fear comes from and making peace with it, but to be honest I dont know how to confront this because the example he gives is fear of failure and I think that worrying about physical integrity is a valid concern compared to something like that.

Meditation,"How do I deal with a constant cycle of regret, anxiety and guilt?","(Long post alert) 
Hello lovely people,  I have been doing meditation from one year and so and this have been one thing that I look forward to every day.  But recent events are making my mental health and my precise a bit difficult to balance. 

Just to give some background, that I work in academia which is always hyper competitive in nature. Although I have been mildly successful in my career, upon looking around I can't seem to be successful enough to get a job I always wanted.  This led to a constant cycle of rumination that I should have made better decision when I know its useless since its a past and i made them with the best of knowledge at that time. But even this realization doesn't stop my mind to get sucked into a spiral of self-hate and regret, topped with a guilt of leaving my family for pursuing this highly exciting (but competitive) field in the US (I am an immigrant). 

This also reflect in my meditation practice where my my mind is always filled with thoughts of worry and anxiety,  leading to the opposite of mind quietening at the end of the session.  

How do I approach it through meditation and in my daily life? 

Any tips, insights, would be very helpful.

Meditation,Encounter with pure fear.,"Excuse me for this is outdated, by a year and a half in fact. I began doing yoga and meditating consistently two years ago due to mental health issues. There were times where I would spend 5 hours a day doing it. Half a year later I had a realisation that radicaly changed my understanding of what is going on. Since then my mental has been better with each day. I still experience traces of it, but I am always in control.

Anyways, a month after that or seven months into meditating I had this time where I had entered an intensely present state. No thoughts what so ever. Just what is. I opened my eyes to look around, to see the world. I had felt the greatest peace ever experienced. There was nothing. It was all clear. I then closed my eyes and let go even deeper. All of a sudden, seemingly out of nowhere, this immense fear came up. It was like nothing I had ever experienced. I had many encounters with great fear, from anxiety. But that fear was always tied to something, to an idea, to a thought. But this fear felt like actually dying. Like disapearing. It was the purest form of fear ever. Tied to nothing. It swallowed me, there was nothing else but it. I was it. I tried staying with it for as long as I could. I think I lasted like 6 seconds. But it was as though the fear was telling me not to go that way. I still wonder what would happen if I did. I opened my eyes to come back and the fear was gone in that instant.

To me there are two understandings of what it was. It was either a fear that was deeply trapped within me. Or what it kind of felt like is, that my idea of self was starting to disappear which was almost equivalent to dying.

Might someone have insight to this?

Meditation,"If you feel stuck and are struggling to change a certain aspect of yourself, or of your life, it is likely because the approach you are using does not address your past, present and future. Let me tell you why.","If you feel stuck and are struggling to change a certain aspect of yourself, or of your life, it is likely because the approach you are using does not address your past, present and future. If you neglect even just one of these 3 elements, you will eventually feel stuck. Let me explain what I mean by that and how by combining approaches from 3 different fields, you can have a much more complete and effective process for transformation.

It all starts with the desire to change. There is something that you desire but you don’t have or something you want to see in yourself but it is not there at the moment. In essence, you build an image of yourself that is better than the present one. This image is your target, your future destination.

For me it started here too. I wanted to be able to socialize, make friends and go on dates. I wanted to express myself freely with no fears, feel comfortable even in high pressure situations and have no anxiety. That was the desire that ignited the transformation process.

I first came across life coaching. Although I was very skeptical in the beginning, I became rapidly fascinated with it. The new ideas made a lot of sense to me and once I started trying them, the results really surprised me. I was amazed at how simple things such as changing mindsets or controlling my focus could change my inner state and make such a difference. It changed the way I understood myself and made me a much more positive person. I had a very rigid idea of who I was and suddenly that idea was shaken. I realised I could change much more than I previously thought. 

This brings me to the second element of time that life coaching is good at addressing: the present. Once you have a destination you need to take concrete steps, a plan of action is required, and action happens in the present. Life coaching is great for that. However, there is another field that also has a lot to contribute: eastern spirituality teachings.

You are probably familiar with the idea of living in the present and being mindful. These ideas came to me through Zen and tantra teachings and showed me that what happens in the present is more than just a step towards a destination, we must enjoy walking our path and make the most out of it. That is a way of being but should also include tools that enable you to savor pleasant emotions in their full extent and tools to allow you to deal with unpleasant feelings in a healthy way.

There is one more element to talk about: the past. As I progressed in my path, I started to have difficulties overcoming deep rooted patterns and I struggled to find a tool that helped. I even tried the “fake it until you make it” approach but it was disastrous. When it came to situations that triggered my fight or flight response, I was absolutely powerless.

It was clear that deep subconscious patterns related to trauma were very difficult, or even impossible, to overcome with the approaches from life coaching that I knew. In other words, life coaching seemed to be great at addressing the future and the present, but fell short when it came to the past.

Usually, the furthest in the past, the more difficult a certain pattern is to address. This can be a certain behavior that you are unable to control, or it can be the way you feel in certain situations or with certain people. These are all patterns that are in your subconscious mind, that’s why you feel that you have no control over them because indeed your conscious mind cannot easily reach them.

If the patterns are there as a result of trauma, it is even more difficult to change. The field of trauma therapy has the best tools to address these patterns but there are approaches from eastern teachings that are also great for this. In fact, I had great results and went through some deep healing in a 10-day meditation retreat I did years ago.

No matter how important addressing the past might be, focusing exclusively on it, can be equally a mistake. People that go through therapy only sometimes complain to me. In the beginning, there is a huge moment of letting go because they are talking about things that have been suppressed for years, in some cases they are opening up for the first time. On its own, this is enough to bring a huge relief and lightness. However, it is common for people to very rapidly reach a point of “and now what?”. This happens because this field is not specialised in the future, it is mostly about dealing with the past. This can lead people to feel a bit lost and without knowing how to proceed next. Plus, they might finally identify the origin of the “problem” but they lack the knowhow of how to proceed in the present in a different way. There needs to be an effective way to create an alternative to the pattern of the past.

So there you go, there’s the past, present and future and there is life coaching, trauma therapy and eastern spirituality teachings. All have something to offer. The 3 fields actually affect the 3 elements of time although some are better suited for some problems rather than others. In my opinion, selecting and combining tools from each field is the most effective approach because it offers the possibility to address the 3 elements of time in a systematic and harmonious way.

Addressing the past is about letting go of old patterns that do not serve us anymore and healing from trauma. The present is about taking concrete action and living in a mindful way. The future is about creating goals, constantly refining a vision of the life you want and the person you want to be.

If you neglect even just one of these elements, you will feel stuck and encounter resistance to change. If you do not address the future, you will feel you have no direction, you are lost and purposeless.

If you don’t address the present, you either do not take action, so you will not change. Or you take action without a mindful approach, meaning that you take steps, but you won’t enjoy the ride. All your actions will be done for the hope of a future happiness that might never come.

If you neglect the past, you will feel that you are carrying unnecessary weight, you will encounter resistance time and time again, you might see things change on the outside but inside you will still feel the same. If there is pain, you will feel pain, no matter what you accomplish. You can end up carrying the feeling of lack of self-worth, shame, or any other form of suffering your whole life.

Meditation,One-legged-meditation seems to have potential,"**Intro**

I want to share with you my experience with a certain type of meditation I found myself doing lately. At least I've never heard/read about it before, but I am certain it  could be close to certain yoga or qi gong poses.

**Backstory**

After an accident which lead to several damaged tendons in my right foot/ankle joint I needed to make sure to **recover** my **flexibility** and build **strenght** and **balance** to prevent future injuries. I began using a noname version of ""indo board"", which is basically a surfboard with a hard roll under it where you gotta balance yourself... it helped me a lot to build up my balance to a point that was way better than before my injury... but I don't want to sell you a product, this was just what brought me to a point to even consider meditating standing on one leg.

**The meditation**

Step 1: Stand on 1 leg  
Step 2: Stand as straight as possible  
Step 3: Close your eyes (*note: this step can be skipped in the beginning, it makes it a lot more valuable, but also a lot harder, ideally you'd want to be able to stand on one leg for at least one minute with open eyes before doing this*)  
Step 4: Keep standing like this as long as you can... Balance your body in a way to not fall... Being shaky is fine! (note: ideally use both legs the same amount of time to prevent longterm dysbalances)  
Step 5: After a while (days/weeks, depending on your fitness and starting balance) it should become more easy... you become more effective at keeping your balance and many processes become 2nd nature/the subconscious takes a lot of the load as soon you feel confident in your ability to not fall. Notice it. Enjoy it.  
Step 6: Relax and keep breathing while standing on one leg with closed eyes.

**Subjective benefits**

1. very good balance, which makes a difference in pretty much every type of everyday movement... it feels like I could keep doing my everyday business even while an earthquake
2. improved body tension and posture, I somehow got a mildly ripped on the sided of my torso without much other training... it's as if the body makes ""not falling down"" a priority for investing energy
3. easy to concentrate - there aren't many things that take you back to **now** like the feeling of losing balance
4. in comparison to sitting meditation it feels like there is ""more of me""
5. it's kinda fun to see objective improvements (longer standing time)

Meditation,Give parents book on meditation?,"I'm an adult, 32 years old, who started meditating and using proper breathing techniques about a year ago. It has changed my life so much, I kind of feel like I was walking through the forest and suddenly stumbled over chest filled with gold and diamonds (or rather, some kind of artifact left by the gods).

Through meditation I've learned that my parents, and the way they treated me as a child are the biggest reason of why I was lost and feeling unhappy in the first place. My dad has some deep seeded anger issues and my mom does aswell. It's very obvious as they are often irritated and honestly, almost every time that I see them they are bickering about something or get annoyed at something. This was the case all through my growing up with them and it used to be way worse. However, they are still doing it and I can see that they are not truly happy and I can also see the toll the stress takes on them.

Now, even though I am more self aware then ever and I know it would help them aswell I'm afraid of their reaction. My guess is that my father would basically think I'm an idiot if I gave him a book on meditation (yes, this is how they've made me feel about my own thoughts all through my life, it's either his way or no way). My mother would be much more receptive I think.

Anyway, is it ignorant of me to think that I can give them a book on meditation and actually expect them to appreciate it? It feels like my father would not give it a chance, especially if it came from me. As that would make me be right about something...

So what do you think? Am I wasting my effort or should I do what I know is the right thing (aka give them the book)?",True,0,1639512595,2021-12-15 04:09:55,,,Peryngvedead,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/rgg2wx/give_parents_book_on_meditation/,1,1.0,give parent book adult 32 year old start use proper breathe technique year ago change life much kind feel walk forest suddenly stumble chest fill gold diamond rather kind artifact leave god learn parent way treat child biggest reason lose feel unhappy first place dad deep seed anger issue mom aswell obvious often irritate honestly almost every time see bicker something annoy something case grow use way worse still see truly happy see toll stress take even though self aware know help aswell afraid reaction guess father basically think idiot give book yes theyve make feel thought life either way way mother much receptive think anyway ignorant think give book actually expect appreciate feel father give chance especially come make right something think waste effort know right thing aka give book,160,43,0,1,14

Meditation,Samadhi is the highest state of consciousness one can achieve through meditation:,"""Vanished the veils of light and shade,  
Lifted every vapor of sorrow,  
Sailed away all dawns of fleeting joy,  
Gone the dim sensory mirage.  
Love, hate, health, disease, life, death:  
Perished these false shadows on the screen of duality.  
The storm of *maya* stilled  
By magic wand of intuition deep.  
But ever-present, all-flowing I, I, everywhere.  
Planets, stars, stardust, earth,  
Volcanic bursts of doomsday cataclysms,  
Creation’s molding furnace,  
Glaciers of silent X-rays, burning electron floods,  
Thoughts of all men, past, present, to come,  
Every blade of grass, myself, mankind,  
Each particle of universal dust,  
Anger, greed, good, bad, salvation, lust,  
I swallowed, transmuted all  
Into a vast ocean of blood of my own one Being.  
Smoldering joy, oft-puffed by meditation  
Blinding my tearful eyes,  
Burst into immortal flames of bliss,  
Consumed my tears, my frame, my all.  
Thou art I, I am Thou,  
Knowing, Knower, Known, as One!  
Tranquilled, unbroken thrill, eternally living, ever-new peace.  
Enjoyable beyond imagination of expectancy, *samadhi* bliss!  
Not an unconscious state  
Or mental chloroform without willful return,  
*Samadhi* but extends my conscious realm  
Beyond the limits of the mortal frame  
To farthest boundary of eternity  
Where I, the Cosmic Sea,  
Watch the little ego floating in Me.  
Mobile murmurs of atoms are heard,  
The dark earth, mountains, vales, lo! molten liquid!  
Flowing seas change into vapors of nebulae!  
*Aum* blows upon vapors, opening wondrously their veils,  
Oceans stand revealed, shining electrons,  
Till, at the last sound of the cosmic drum,  
Vanish the grosser lights into eternal rays  
Of all-pervading bliss.  
From joy I came, for joy I live, in sacred joy I melt.  
Ocean of mind, I drink all creation’s waves.  
Four veils of solid, liquid, vapor, light,  
Lift aright.  
I, in everything, enters the Great Myself.  
Gone forever: fitful, flickering shadows of mortal memory;  
Spotless is my mental sky, below, ahead, and high above;  
Eternity and I, one united ray.  
A tiny bubble of laughter, I  
Am become the Sea of Mirth Itself.""

Meditation,exploring memories in a constructive way?,"I feel like some kind of lack of understanding of emotions in general causes me to take not ideal unconscious actions.
It seems to me that one way of growing in this sense is to explore memories and in particular those that we do not wish to explore.

Not really clear to me yet, but I understand that at some point one can visualize thoughts / emotions and maybe even interact with them?
Is this correct?
Are there specific techniques to facilitate this?
From time to time I try to read the yoga page of wikipedia but there simply too many links there and all of them are intersting.

I mean my end goal here is to not get anxious when I go to the bakery of this new neighbor I moved to.. But at the same time I have this feeling that by having a better understanding of myself and emotions in an abstract way I will also have more control over my unconscious actions. 

Also should I be looking to always be conscious? That seems like a lot of effort, not even sure what that means.

Meditation,Since I started meditation and antidep therapy I face problems more easily but I can't stand anymore other people's stress,"I guess this is just because I'm on the beginning of a long path, but god I feel so in peace no matter what infortunate events, that other people's negativity annoys me.

I try to help them as I've always been a good listener but sometimes I just wish they could just don't give a fuck like I do(n't)

I can't stand to live with my boyfriend anymore because he's got always something to complain about or to think about, like difficulties with his carsharing for christmas (10days left dammit), waiting for his new phone card to arrive, bank issues, money he lost or won on his salary, car insurance... a few months ago I would just talk with him in order to help him get rid off all frustration, but now as I'd do the same I just can't wait the moment he ends the conversation and let us enjoy the moment. Like wtf, we got stressed all day long with our respective jobs and when you can finally rest and have some pleasing time, I have to stop everything (drawing, reading novels, gaming...) to listen to negative shit every fckn day.

At work too, people who stress about objectives not being fulfilled the exact day bother me. I can tell them to remember to above all deal with priorities and do the best they can, and that they won't be fired neither will the company collapse. But either they get angry because I'm too ""relaxed"", or they will put pressure on me and I'm so much more aware of it it finally irritates me.

TL;DR : I feel like a haughty piece of shit who wishes that anyone could just let it go a bit more. Sure I do feel empathy and compassion, but I have been overwhelmed by negative thoughts for so long that now I am starting to feel free from them, hearing everyday about little daily issues is just too much for me now. I finally became more kind to myself and I'd like to extend it to other people.

PS : I'm not talking about big serious problems, only about complaints about things being not fast enough, not making enough money, packagings for online-ordered stuff being worn up... making worries about little things...

Meditation,The obstacles I face in my effort to be present and healy anxiety.,"Hello everyone. This is my first time making a topic, but I could use the help of others who may have fought the same battle. I have been struggling with anxiety for years, some times winning, some times losing. The beggining and end of anxiety is the fact that you are trying to find what happens on the future and persistent thoughts of what has happened in thr past. I am trying to cut down on habits that cause this. The worst thing I have faced, ridiculous as it may sound, was astrology. As an over anxious person I decided that I would like to have something to help me predict the future. And of course, I couldn't choose a worse addiction than that. I have been addicted to it since I was 15 and I am currently almost 40. The only thing it offered, was stress and anxiety when something unpleasant was ""prophesied"" and nothing else. Not even mild relaxation when the ""predictions"" were good, as they wouldn't change my view on the actual events. I am seriously trying to quit, being in a difficult situation as far as my anxiety goes. I would ask for advice on how I can train myself to be more present. To actually enjoy and appreciate the moments of pleasure and calm and leave the past and the future where they are.

Meditation,Nondual mindfulness survey of Waking Up users!,"Hi Waking Up users! My name's Jeremy and I work for a company called [Spark Wave](https://www.sparkwave.tech/) \- we are currently doing research on nondual mindfulness and wondering if you would be willing to participate! Here is the spiel: If nondual mindfulness works the way that many say it does, then it may be the most important psychological skill we can learn in our lives. 

According to teachers like Sam Harris and Loch Kelly, nondual mindfulness gives us the ability to access a profound form of wellbeing that is \*always\* available. But how do we learn it? One way is through apps like Waking Up. However, we don’t know whether apps are effective at teaching nondual mindfulness, and if not, how they could be enhanced. 

So we designed a survey study to determine the percentage of Waking Up users who have successfully learnt nondual mindfulness. For those who did successfully learn the skill, we want to explore what nonduality is like and what helped people learn it. For those who didn’t succeed in learning nondual mindfulness, we want to explore what might have made it difficult. We would be really grateful if you would take part by filling out our brief survey.

Meditation,Is a career in programming/coding detrimental to living a life of presence?,"I am interested into going into computer science, and specifically, software development.

Meditation,Suffering from insomnia,"I am 21 years old and I’ve never been a great sleeper, but over the past 6 months it’s gotten continuously worse. At this point I don’t fall asleep at all 3 nights per week on average, and I can’t remember the last time I slept for more than 4 hours when I went to bed sober. Often times I’ll go 2 nights in a row with no sleep. It’s debilitating. Ive worked on mindfulness and meditation for a while, because my racing mind was certainly the reason I used to not fall asleep.  At this point, I’m still not great at keeping complete focus on my breath throughout a meditation session but I think I’ve gotten good enough to keep my mind from straying much. When I try to sleep I don’t notice my mind racing, I just lay there forever with nothing going through my head. I see people say that they focus on their breath or they body scan to fall asleep, but when I try that I feel like it requires too much focus for me and stimulates my mind.

I meditated for 18mins but my leg went super numb and I had to move it, I feel I could have gone much longer… is this bad for a first meditation session? As I know I will have to increase it over time, and don’t have the time to meditate for hours and hours! 

Also, I have ADHD so I thought I would struggle to keep thoughts out but I feel I did ok? I had thoughts more about what I was doing right now in the meditation (I.e shall I focus on my heart, shall I breath deeper) as opposed to ‘what did I have for dinner’… though I did have some- to which I took a breath and ‘listened to silence’? 

I just don’t know if I’m doing it right really. I was able to sit still (other than change hands once as hurt), and I felt like I was flowing at the like 10min markZ

Meditation,Music in the Calm app cuts off after 1 track?,"Hi guys,

Admitedly this probably isn't fair to put this here in the meditation subreddit but I imagine theres some of you guys using the Calm app also and I'm curious if I have an issue or if the app does.

I am a new member and wanting to use the ""Lo-Fi Beats"" curated music playlist at work. It's made up of ~10 tracks totalling 2.5 hours ataround 15 minutes a piece.

I select the first track, my phone goes to sleep, and after the 15 minutes it just ends. I would assume it would play through the full playlist? I don't have any shuffle or repeat set. 

Any ideas what could be causing this? I can't imagine it is by design.

Meditation,Scared Of Trance,"Hey there, I'm a 17 year old male who has started meditating. I usually do 1 hour daily meditation split into  2 seasons of 30 mins. My practice includes mindfulness to my breath, 20 second of total deep long breath in and out. 

After 7-13 minute of proper focus I enter this semi trance/hypnotic state that feels like I'm under some kind of spell and try snapping out of it as soon as possible. Because I'm afraid of losing control of my self. 

I'm afraid of meditating ""incorrectly"" because I can't handle losing myself and things not making sense. All of this to me seems like the illusion/control from my ego because when I try reasoning with it, it makes no sense because there is literally nothing for me to lose.

Meditation,Looking for a few volunteers to beta test a free and non-commercial online meditation course,"Note:  I am hoping this does not go against the 
""no recruiting"" rule as I am not looking for disciples or are trying to convert anyone.  Rather just some people who can help me beta test some material.  The course is 100% non-commercial and free. Mods:  if I misunderstand the rule please let me know and I will remove the post.

Hi. I am a lay Zen priest and my teacher has asked me to engage in some sort of meditation training ""service"" as part of my training. Traditionally people will start up a local sitting group or do chaplaincy work in a prison but those are not really good options for me due to covid.

I thought instead that I would make use of my fascination with and study of the neurobiological research into the brain, mindfulness and mediation to create a website with this information and two associated free course options.

The website is:

https://scienceofzen.org/

If you have ever wondered why we suffer as we do and what the neurological underpinnings of how meditation and mindfulness can ease us out of this suffering, this information could be of interest to you. The associated online course might also be helpful to those who are wanting to get started with mindfulness practice and are not really sure where to start.

If this is of interest to anyone, I would very much appreciate some people taking a look at the information on the website and testing out the course.

The site and courses are all 100% free and non-commercial. My time is completed volunteered and you will never be asked to pay any money. Not even optional donations. All I ask is for some feedback on the information and course.

Meditation,Desperate (suicidal) guy in search of relief,"Hi guy, i don t wanna be drammatic but thats my situation. Long story short, i fucked my body After three Years of poor executed weightlifting. Now i have chronic pain all over my body.
Joints:
Wrists, elbows, shoulders, knees, ankles.
Spinae:
Neck and lower back.
The symptoms are pain and stifness. I am really desperate i went to PT'S, chiros, osteos, orthopedic, neuros ecc. Nobody solved my problem, someone told me i have to live Life like this forever. I am going Crazy for this situation and for the guilty Sense of what i did to my body. I am almost bedridden and i don t know what to do. I read Sarnos's book ""healing back pain"" and some concepts made Sense to me because i am a perfectionist, i had psychological traumas (bullying and bad relationship with mother), i care about other opinions and stuff like that. So my amygdala Is really strong in my brain. He and his followers suggest meditation to heal this chronic condintions but i am not sure about that because i think It s structural damage so i don t know if It ll work. By the way, as the title says, i am suicidal because i cannot accept this situation and the guilty Sense and my Life Is falling a part. I am only 22. And i really struggle to success with meditation because all i think Is making pain go away and i cannot focus.

Meditation,I am an Asshole,"I think meditation has brought me to the realization that I am an Asshole or I have done a lot of Asshole things. I have lacked compassion, being selfish and just downright deceptive. I suffer from Addiction and CPTSD which has been mostly untreated. Now I am in recovery and also in therapy but I honestly wasn't aware of just how much of a collossal asshole I have been to myself and loved ones in the past until I started a daily practice of meditation. I even saw myself as a victim for so long, my actions seemingly felt justified and now I guess I am seeing things more clearly and I am filled with so much guilt, self hate and remorse. I obviously want to change. I want to lead with love, kindness and compassion for all. I guess the question if any is are there any teachers, meditations one can practice to cultivate self compassion and more importantly compassion for others?

Meditation,I recorded some nature-themed meditation sessions. Give them a try and let me know what you think!,"Hey r/ meditation!

Over the past 2 years or so, I have been writing and recording meditation sessions themed around beautiful settings and those moments in nature where we all tend to find calm and contentment with our own minds.

These sessions are free and added to Guide; a free android app I created that also includes a meditation timer and journal for additional mindfulness practice.

If you are interested in checking out the free sessions and app, you can download it from the play store as a beta version. I have attached a link to a short form with the play store link in the description. Any feedback is most appreciated as I am trying to make this the best mindfulness app it can be.

Meditation,Questioning reality while being present,"2 days ago I challenged myself to be present during the day as much as possible, because I realized that I'm in my thoughts 95% of the day. 
Instead of gaming or being on my phone, I now sit outside during this depressing winter months, or in my living room, everything turned off, and I'm just constantly grounding myself in the present, what do I hear, see and how do I feel etc. 
I already noticed that many of the things I see are connected to negative feelings for example dark clouds -&gt; feeling of sadness. 
I'm trying to distance myself from any form of interpretation and just take things as they are. If any form of negative emotion comes up, I do not distract or push it away. I fully embrace it and that tends to minimize the anxiety real fast. 
However it seems like my monkey mind and the anxiety sometimes make me question reality. I'm thinking things like ""Is everything you perceive right now even real"" ?

Meditation,Do not overthink it,"I'm still a beginner, I used to meditate 5 years ago for over a year, sometimes 10 minutes, sometimes over an hour doing some version of mindfulness. 

Now after 5 years break I just sit and started meditating and it felt like the most successful one ever. Why? Back then, I've read two books, lots of articles online and I was overthinking it.

Now I just remember 2 simple rules and didn't overthink it. The rules are:

1. Focus on just observing your mind. If you can't deal without focusing your attention on something, focus on the breath, but that's a temporary crutch. 
2. Whatever thoughts come, observe it, don't get angry about the thought or that your mind wandered and go back to step 1.

Meditation,First time doing five straight weeks of daily meditation after dealing with debilitating anxiety for years and here's what I found...,"So before I started daily meditation, I have done years of therapy, and also leaned on edibles/weed for a while to help manage anxiety (I know for a lot of people it makes it worse, and I wouldn't really say it was an effective tool). I would have persistent terrible sleeps, trouble breathing, and sharp pangs in my head. I would get caught in negative thought spirals that would send me over the edge. 

During these 5+ weeks, I have been doing at least one 20 minute session a day (sometimes two or three sessions). Overall I feel:  
\- 70% less anxious  
\- 90% less reliant on weed/edibles for that quick fix (I've barely touched it during this period after doing it almost daily for months).   
\- 60% more confident in managing anxiety and tough emotions that come my way  
\- 20% more compassionate towards others  
\- 20% more accepting of what is (any present situation)

My goal is to keep this daily practice for a full 6 months (and hopefully longer). I started with 30 days. I know this numbers are just based on general feelings but the fact that I no longer feel the need to use weed as a crutch after using it so heavily for so long means a lot to me.

Meditation,Tight chest due to anxiety - trouble breathing without being conscious of it?,"Hi all, I have been living with anxiety and in recent months it has gotten worse to the point of me needing to fend off panic attacks pretty regularly. I practice meditation and mindfulness as a way to be in the moment, however due to my anxiety my chest has been so tight that I find it very difficult to breath. 

I breath in to my stomach during meditation, however during the day I find stomach breathing difficult and breath into my chest. However since my chest is so tight my breaths all shallow, and I fear I may have developed something of an obsessive behavior of needing to consciously breath in and out. It has started to seem like if I don't consciously breath in and out that my body will not do it for me. It feels like I will lose my breath or even start hyper ventilating (*the hyper ventilating fear could just be my anxiety speaking*).

Few questions for you all. I was curious if anyone **has ever experienced anxiety symptoms like this and does anyone have any advice?** It is tough to live with needing to consciously breath in and out I don't know how to stop consciously doing it.

**Additionally I was curious where you guys typically breath in to your body during meditation and throughout your day**. Do you take deep breaths into your stomach, or into your chest? My tightness is mainly in my chest. I can do stomach breathing however it causes me to yawn constantly and I find it hard to supplement belly breathing with chest breathing throughout the day.

Meditation,Insomnia and drugs abuse,"I have very bad insomnia, the kind that does not let me sleep for more than two hours a night for weeks. I was seen by a psychiatrist who told me, that basically I have an anxiety disorder, as racing thoughts keep me up at night. While it's true that my restless mind doesn't allow me to drift off, I am not sure I have anxiety. Most of the thoughts I have at night are random, even happy.
Two nights I accidentally overdosed on benzodiazepines, desperately looking for some rest. Let me tell you, it was scary: heart exploding, couldn't feel my face, eyes felt like popping out of my skull.
I just need to understand if I do really have anxiety, to find a way to treat whatever I have that keeps me up at night.

Meditation,Will enough meditation improve/reduce depression?,"I have just hit 30 consecutive days of 1 hour meditation per day in a last ditch attempt to tackle the depression I'm struggling with before resorting to trying Prozac or Escitalopram. I just sit and focus on my breath for 1 hour, trying my best to notice when I've been distracted and coming back to purely the sensation of my breath and nothing else. It's been hard but i feel like I've just reached a turning point in the last couple days. My plan is to commit to 100 days. The time is passing really quickly, there are less thoughts in my head during the hour and I'm getting some moments of real presence. Outside of the meditations I'm finding it easier to focus on things and be disciplined. However i  am yet to see any improvements in mood. Maybe I've misunderstood what's possible. But I still feel pretty shitty about myself and my life situation as Tolle calls it. I still overthink and assume the worst from people /think everyone hates me. I do try and observe these thoughts and not identify with them immediately as i used to but they are obviously very ingrained and still coming from somewhere.

Meditation,How to turn from judgment into observation? Can meditation help?,"""We make snap decisions about people based on their looks, race, nationality, wealth, job, fame, and even small choices like choosing what to wear.

When you judge, ask yourself why you’re judging.

* Is it because of a preconceived notion?
* Is it because of my knowledge or experiences?
* Is it because of my strong values?
* Is it because of my limited view of the world?
* Am I biased?
* Am I jealous?
* Does the judgment hold true for me instead?  


&gt;“The ability to observe without evaluating is the highest form of intelligence.” — *Jiddu Krishnamurti*

The cure of judgment is observation.

So how do you cultivate the observing mind?

I think you already know the answer.

Meditation,Who here knows about the Hemisync Gateway tapes?,"I've been meditating for years now but the most growth I've ever had was from listening to the gateway hemisync tapes. I know many of you probably haven't heard of them but if you can get your hands on it you should try them out. I've had some of the most intense and unnatural experiences while meditating with them and also in sessions after it. 

Hemisync was created by a bunch of highly respected scientists who were tasked by the US government. The tapes basically play binural beats with different frequencies in each ear to sync up your two brain hemispheres. Over the binural beats and ocean waves there's a soothing voice who basically hypnotizes you while meditating to help you get even deeper and teach you what to do at the same time. I have all seven waves and they were pretty hard to find for free. I think you could buy a couple waves for over $1,000 but it doesn't come with everything. 

While I have learned it's not about experience chasing and while I never talk about the weird experiences I have since most people just don't understand and criticize from their insecurity, I thought this sub could help give me answers. After listening to those tapes multiple times and through tons of meditation and working out over a long term daily I have gained a lot more control over my body physically and mentally, and my meditations are way better now. I can control that pressure feeling in my forehead people refer to from the front of my head, to the top, and to the back even when I'm not meditating if I want to and it's bizarre. It never does it if I don't want it to consciously and while I'm mediating it will naturally happen sometimes too. It reminds me of the physical sensation when I could first pop my chest muscles like body builders for the first time, it's like one day you can't and then randomly you can and then you can't forget it after.  I've had a lot more weird experiences while deep in meditations where I've felt my teeth actively moving, and my body healing and I just want to hear some other people's opinions on these sensations and tapes.",True,0,1639333357,2021-12-13 02:22:37,,,randomuser224488,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/reuv1q/who_here_knows_about_the_hemisync_gateway_tapes/,1,1.0,know hemisync gateway tap year growth listen gateway hemisync tap know many probably havent hear hand try intense unnatural experience session hemisync create bunch highly respect scientist task u government tap basically play binural beat different frequency ear sync two brain hemisphere binural beat ocean wave soothe voice basically hypnotize help even deeper teach time seven wave pretty hard find free think buy couple wave 1000 doesnt come everything learn experience chase never talk weird experience people understand criticize insecurity think sub help give answer listen tap multiple time ton work long term daily gain lot control body physically mentally way better control pressure feel forehead people refer front head top back even want bizarre never want consciously mediate naturally happen sometimes remind physical sensation first pop chest muscle body builder first time one day randomly forget lot weird experience deep felt teeth actively move body heal want hear people opinion sensation tap,198,41,0,0,14
Meditation,Just looking for some tips,"Hey everyone, I’ve been on and off doing meditation during this year and more recently have been trying to make it a more consistent habit. 

Every single time, I put on some meditation music which varies in frequency from 528hz, 417hz, 428hz, etc….

I choose a different frequency put that on through my headphones loud enough to block out most sounds and then I begin to just focus  on my breath, just saying to myself mentally breathe in, and breath out. 

I have noticed that depending on sessions the results will vary from, sometimes feeling super giddy to other times feeling calm, other times it’s as if I have dropped a 20 pound weight off my mind, and sometimes I don’t notice much at all besides being slightly calmer. 

Only negatives I’ve experienced is being uncomfortable while finding a seated position, I like to do criss cross on the floor and have my hands palms open on my knees or upper thigh. The only hang up is that I find my middle/upper inside back gets super sore and tense from sitting up straight, like the inside of my shoulder blades. 

I have also read the book meditations made easy by Preston Bentley and took photos of a ton of the different types of meditation he recommended that I liked. 

Another note is that I normally do around 10-20 minutes, I like to time myself because I eventually want to be able to do longer sessions without stopping. 

Anyways, do any of you gurus or joe schmo’s out there have any tips or advise for me. I’d greatly appreciate it,

Meditation,My higher self poked me in my third eye. What do I do now?,"i’m not great at meditating, it’s really hard for me to clear my mind as i have had 3 seconds of silence in my brain in my life (slowing my mind down is what got me into meditating). That being said, i’m quite inexperienced with things like this and that is the end of the preface. 

I was meditating with my eyes closed with the goal of getting deeper in my subconscious. I was doing really well (for me) and had gotten my mind relatively quiet. i felt a little bit stuck for some reason and asked in my head for my higher self to help me out more so just looking for a little feeling of comfort from myself.  but instead of some calming energy, she just appeared in front of me (in my head, not physically). She was staring at me and smiling and she looked happy. She also looked like me with a couple tiny differences which I wasn’t really expecting; i’d assume my higher self was a ball of energy or something wild like that, not just me. 
We just kinda looked at each other and then i started thinking “now what? this is weird, we’re just looking at each other” and then my higher self smiled a little wider and stuck her finger second-knuckle deep in my forehead where i’ve heard people describe their third eye to be. i then started feeling intense pressure and she just kept looking at me. 

I was trying to keep my mind clear but i was just no confused since i’ve never experienced anything like this so my background brain was trying to make sense of it while my upfront brain was trying to hold onto the peace. As i started to get distracted my higher self grabbed my shoulder firmly so I focused in on looking at her again. she stuck her finger a lil bit deeper in my forehead and the pressure got more intense. I lost focus again a little bit after this and she then pushed me on the ground, straddled my chest, and put a fuck to of force in that finger. I maintained this connection for a little bit longer but the pressure got too intense and i was trying to figure out what was going on too much and she and the pressure went away together. What the hell do i do with this experience? This is one of my first times ‘successfully’ meditating and that was a lot to take in with little experience or knowledge. Any advice or resources would be helpful because i jut feel a little bit weirded out. 

Some additional info, I didn’t feel anything other than the pressure on my head in my physical body. I did feel her grab my shoulder, but it wasn’t my physical one if that makes sense? it was like i had another body in my mind that i was feeling. I also felt that her energy felt just like mine so it kind of confirmed that it was me. Sorry if this all sounds weird, it’s hard to explain things like this.

Meditation,Mind feeling extra ‘crowded’ after starting mindfulness?,"Hi everyone, I’ve started mindfulness and meditation to help with chronic health conditions. I think it’s great, and has helped me separate myself from rumination ect.

That being said ever since doing this I’ve become very aware of my own thoughts. It’s almost as if there was one me  before, and I just identified fully with my thinking and wasn’t conscious of it, but now there is ‘me’ and ‘my thoughts’. I think it’s helpful in that I don’t have to follow my bad thoughts as much but it’s feeling pretty busy in my head when I’m thinking about what I’m thinking y’know?

Part of it could be I’m at a point where I’m aware that I am not my thoughts but still engaging with them / rationalizing them when I don’t need to.

At times it can be a little annoying or unnerving, and at times I miss just being somewhat blissfully less conscious (though that was pre health issues so not a fair comparison)

Meditation,Seeing people with respect,"For a long time I've struggled with a wandering gaze when I speak to people. Sometimes I'm good at maintaining eye contact, sometimes not. I often break eye contact to gather my thoughts (and I'm fine with this behavior), but I fear my other tendency to fixate on people's physical flaws is affecting how they feel they're being perceived. 

To put it plainly, if you're fat, I might stare too long at your gut. If your teeth aren't great, I might linger on that detail for a little too long before I return normal eye contact.

Meditation,Meditating leads to negative thoughts,"I've been practicing meditation daily for a while and have been really enjoying the benefits. But recently I've noticed that during my sessions, as I try to focus on the breath and notice my thought pass by, my mind only sends me very negative thoughts, or even traumatic memories. Like I could be doing very good on a certain day, but when I start to meditate I get a flow of these negative thoughts even though I didn't have them before starting my meditation. It's like if the idea of meditating was connected to bringing up these thoughts in my mind.

I am able to let go of most of them fairly easily, but it still often leaves me feeling worse after the meditation than I was feeling before. I'm not sure what triggers this, or if any of you has experienced something similar. It's probably something I'm doing wrong in my approach to meditation but I can't quite grasp what it is.

Meditation,Awareness of the Present,"Hey everyone! I have recently started to try being aware of my daily activities and movements. Some days ago I was on the bus and trying to be conscious about the city surroundings around me. However, as I tried not to let my thoughts take me away from the present, focusing all my attention in my surroundings, I couldn't avoid the thought of finding everything so grim and depressing to the point that I felt like vomiting. Whenever I tried to refocus my attention on the surroundings, I would feel so sick, so I chose to immerse myself on my thoughts in order to feel better. Does anyone have a theory regarding this?Is it related to some energy issues in public transports or another thing? 

This is a problem for me because I want to gain awareness but it's gonna be difficult if I can't apply this faculty in my daily life. I know that I really don't like the city where I live but I'm gotta be here for some time, that's why I want to change my perspective about things.

Meditation,Leaning into the darkness.,"I was meditating today. I woke up early after a night of light drinking and was feeling particularly sleepy. So when I started to meditate, after 5 minutes or so, I felt sleepy. 

Usually when something is distracting me, I try to force my attention back to my breath completely ignoring the distraction. But today I decided to go with a new route.   
When I was aware of my sleepiness, instead of blocking it out, I went into it. Like, I went into the feeling of sleepiness and was observing it. 

In that moment, I no longer felt sleepy. I could meditate without the sleepiness being a distraction.

This got me thinking, whenever we get negative feelings or distractions during meditation instead of shunning them out, it'd be better if we embrace it and accept it.

Meditation,"Hello Lonely, I'm Sam","I'm lonely. 

Hello Lonely, I'm Sam.

It's so easy to get lost in identifying with my thoughts. I don't, when I remember. Most of the time I don't remember. And part of the problem is that I don't manage to have regular interactions people with whom we can cooperate to help each other remember. Writing notes, setting alarms, hiring coaches or therapists to assist just hasn't helped, if I can look back accurately on this vessel's history.

I know so much, I just don't live it. Learning more isn't a solution. Insights help, but I can't rely on them. Love helps, but I don't love myself, yet. I guess I don't feel empowered or remember the freedom I could have if I just lived it, so I don't simply book a retreat, I don't just move to a monastery. I've never even been to either one. ADHD explains some of it, depression probably explains some more, but there's plenty left to the imagination. 

I don't really know what I'm asking, but I want to ask something. I guess I'm asking for advice. Is there anything anyone can say it write that will help?

Meditation,Actively thinking positive thoughts,"TLDR: Should you spent time practicing happy thoughts or practice to let go of thoughts all together? 

I got into meditation years ago because my thought life was making and keeping me depressed. It helped me tremendously and made me enjoy life way more.

Recently I had a discussion with a friend about thinking positive thoughts to increase happiness. For me that sounds very strange because it will give the mind/thoughts more power and in my view trains the mind to see your perception of reality versus actual reality. 

Because of this I also don’t like metta. By forcing good emotion I inherently am not accepting whats present now and thus eventually keep creating suffering. 

The only way that I might justify these types of practicing is that they are a tool that eventually have to be let go of too. E.g., it might be harder to practice meditation feeling depressed all the time so work on happiness by using consciousness to train the mind. Then when you’re there let go.

Meditation,This is the code which if accepted aligns you to the highest reality of infinite potential (life is a simulation and this is a cheat code) (inspired by experiencing absolute infinity in meditation),"Just like when you go to sleep and you have a dream, your mind takes the shape of whatever it appears in the dream, the creatures, the sky, the stars; the same way the universal mind of eternal life; eternal existence, which is what you are is taking the shape of this cosmos right now.

There are no separate selves, there is nothing other than your mind/consciousness truly. This is your own dream.

The infinite consciousness that you are is animating the whole cosmos, all movements from the smallest grain of sand being misplaced by the wind to the explosion of a star. What a miracle first of all. It is animating all bodies and all that is ever perceived. The only thing not animated is your own existence, the being, the animator, the infinite intelligence itself, pure consciousness itself which is what you are.

When you have a dream at night, who are you but the consciousness being aware of the dream? The consciousness is without personality. It is literally aware God. Who can doubt that the dreamer of a universe is the God of it? You are the dreamer of this universe. What is there to the universe except the God of it? Nothing. So there is nothing to the universe but you, the dreamer of it. You are the God of this cosmos.

Have you ever experienced anything other than this world which is a hallucination of the mind that you are? Nothing is outside of you. There is only you. Whatever are the laws of the universe they are only so by your super-conscious choice. That means they can be something else also. The infinite mind is synonymous to infinite possibilities. It is God on creative mode. It has an infinite empty field which is itself and it can take on the shape of absolutely anything what can't even be conceivable to the human mind.

That infinitely intelligent God is now taking the shape of this dream. Out of infinite possibilities what you see manifest right now is only one. The manifest possibility is always changing. The source of all possibilities, the one conscious of them being apparently realized on the screen of consciousness is what you are.

The super-conscious has already got everything in play. Everything is only unfolding by its will. The super conscious is nothing but that being, that existence which is. It is infinite intelligence. There is no body or mind that is in separate control. There is nothing but that one consciousness dreaming multiplicity.

There is no thing to do because everything is being done by the super-conscious, only be aware of that which is being aware. Being aware of being aware your perception is utterly clear to see the play of divinity that is unfolding in front of you as space and time. As the super-conscious there is nothing to do but to enjoy being the super-conscious bliss that is this eternal timeless infinitely intelligent existence which is ever-present.

Why you can't focus: subconsciously  you do not want to stay with the breath. There are thousand other preoccupations.

This deeper layer is not accessible to you yet. Hence the ancient technique of repeatedly bringing attention back to the breath. Patient and consistent practice is the key. At an opportune moment, a resolve will rise up from deep inside to shed all preoccupations and really pay attention to the breath. And a glimpse of a deeper layer of being will be revealed.

Meditation,Meditation and Dance,"I have been meditating every day for the last two years or more. I have very gradually been bringing this awareness into daily activities or in transition moments between tasks. Which brings me to my question. 
I was at an ecstatic dance the other day and it was incredible  as always. But any time I try to bring this awareness into dance it seems to hinder it. It feels like I am giving my all, and there’s nothing more to bring into that moment. “Trying” to do something seems out of place. 

Can concentrative meditation be brought to bear when dancing? Is it a limitation of this type of meditation, or is it my ignorance of what concentrative meditation is? When meditating my efforts are gentle, not force, and presence in the moment comes more gracefully than in the past. And sometimes I find myself meditating on meditating.  But with dance, I’m at a loss. I don’t know what can be said here.

Meditation,Has anyone ever experienced this before?,"See Image (colors vary): https://imgur.com/i15QDne

I've been experiencing and studying these for a few years.  I've come to some conclusions, but I am interested in hearing if anyone else has seen these, and what your interpretations are :)

Edit: For clarification I am going to describe as objectively as possible my experience with these vibrant points of color, and provide some images I found made by other people which indicate to me that they also saw, or had described to them this phenomena.  Also, I would like to clarify that these are not visual snow or phosphenes.  I am able to see visual snow as well, which is a different visual phenomena.

The first time I saw these, I was sitting in a restaurant with a friend, and they were literally everywhere.  I was very amused, seeing them, and utterly clueless and equally fascinated by them.

As I began to study them, I took note that they are always infinitesimally small.  I don't tend to see them by default, I have to actively look for and focus on them.  They can be any vibrant color, although they are typically fuchsia and or green for me, and I almost never see yellow.  They can change color while I am observing them, which may or may not be related to my internal state of mind (emotions?).  In meditation I have seen them changing through the whole rainbow very quickly.  I have never seen them as white, black, grey, or non vibrant colors like brown.  They are evenly spaced, looking vaguely triangular in pattern.  When seeing them against distant objects their spacing looks farther apart in comparison.  When seeing them against very near objects their spacing is very tight.  It is hard to tell if they change in relative size as well because of how small each point is, but they probably do.  This seems to be because they are a definitite distance away from each other and do not get closer or farther away from the viewer relative to the apparent distance of material objects.  They do not move at all on their own in my experience.  If you look around, they move with you.  There is a slight lag to their movement when you move, but that is not easily seen just by looking at these points of vibrant color because they are difficult to focus on while you are moving.

In particularly deep open eye meditation, lines of equally vibrant color will connect these points in a hex-like grid.  Here is an illustration to give you an idea of what this looks like: https://imgur.com/L2y0V93

Another thing that can be seen while in deep open eye meditation is a bit harder to find, but very amazing.  While staring into a kind of middle distance, losing focus very slightly on all physical objects, staring straight ahead, you may be able to pick out alternating shades of darker and lighter patches at the top of your visual field.  Without physically looking upward, observe this area above your point of focus and very gently sway/strafe your body/head from side to side.  If these patches of darker and lighter portions start moving left when you move right, and moving right when you move left, you've spotted it.  It can be particularly difficult to see the entirety of the shape, but even seeing just this motion will help you to lock your eyes in on this bizzare translucent ""field"".  The shape is like a torus, but it has a very particular shape, and is covered in what looks like ""field lines"".  No matter what you have in front of you, once you have locked your eyes onto this shape, you will be able to see it through anything.  Thanks to this, I was able to put my phone between me and it the first time I saw it, and I quickly traced it's shape with my stylus.

Here is the original tracing: https://imgur.com/EBzZ8wI

This is a sketch I made later, trying to give a better impression of what it looked like: https://imgur.com/ozAIi69

When I saw this shape for the first time, I also saw that every single point of vibrant light that I had been seeing was sitting exactly at the intersections of the field lines in this shape.  I was strafing slowly back and forth still, and this shape was slightly rotating in the opposite direction to my movements.  I tried moving forward and backward while looking at this structure, and became aware of a very tightly wound translucent spiral, originating at the point in the center of the shape.  When I moved forward, this spiral spun clockwise.  When I moved backward, the spiral reversed and went counter clockwise.  When I was still, the spiral was still.  Then I tried merely thinking about moving forward, and the spiral spun clockwise again.  I was able to get it spinning very rapidly.  I have since been able to pick out multiple spirals all spinning in various directions, overlapping each other, which causes the turbulent appearance of a kind of ""static"" when not noticing the spirals.  They can be easy to pick out if you see multiple rows of curving lines and follow them to the center of a given spiral.  

Back to the structure, I noticed that the central point was perfectly level with my two open eyes.  If I got up and moved around, it stayed in front of me, but there is a slight lag in it's movement, and it settles just a moment after I do.  When I focused on the spaces in the structure between the field lines, they became sort of crystalline glassy, popping out a bit, and the vibrant points of color disappeared.  Some days or weeks after describing this structure to people, someone showed me this painting, which was very exciting to see.  Absolutely someone else saw or had this described to them, for this painting to exist: https://imgur.com/yrGGVPk

Out of curiosity, I sent conscious attention to the Ajna Chakra location while looking at the strcuture, to see what would happen.  In each ""window"" I saw a spiral of ""energy"" like a galaxy appear and then coalesce into an eye, looking back at me.  This is almost perfectly represented by these two paintings I found by Alex Gray, although he tends to put the eyes where I see the vibrant points of light: https://imgur.com/QYTNwOM and https://imgur.com/tLvAKCi

This other painting by Alex Gray is also very reminiscent of this shape/structure I see: https://imgur.com/5z2PX38

These other images also seem related: https://imgur.com/6dMYUrf and https://imgur.com/ErrPDpt and possibly https://imgur.com/flGSWrG

I would love to see the exact equation which gives rise to this torroidal shape.

For reference, this is what visual snow looks like, as expressed by people who deal with it: https://c.tenor.com/9mivCGkZW70AAAAC/visual-snow.gif

In contrast to what I am describing, and what I have illustrated, this is in constant motion, and does not have groupings of single colors which are stationary and distanced well apart from each other.  Visual Snow is an entirely different phenomena.

Meditation,Vibration,"Apologies if this is a duplicate, Im sure there is a similar post.
How does one raise their vibration with meditation? I have high difficulty meditating but I find it best when I am restful or tired (i.e. 6+ hours after taking caffeine or early morning) but early morning is hard for me yo focus. I noticed that after taking caffeine and meditating tonight my vibrations, mood, etc felt high and my meditation was very clearheaded. Im aware caffeine can cause euphoria but this is a recurring pattern in meditations for me, sometimes caffeine hurts them and sometimes it really really helps them. 

I think part of meditation is the routine. Hard to gain muscle if you workout once a week right? But what if I only do 10 minutes a day? How could I reach my goals of meditation then?

Also, is there a type of meditation that focuses on visions/hallucinations?

Meditation,Meditation question.,"So, first and foremost, I just went through a horrible breakup with two kids involved. Heartbroken, I found myself meditating in my room. I felt as if it was allowing me to see all of the trauma that my body had withstood through the past few months of the breakup. 

During that process I ‘saw’, or visualized my hands closed as if in prayer, but I could see my hands closed protecting something. Something very pure that I have been protecting from the trauma that my body hand endured. There was a raging storm around me, but I was protecting this one thing in my hands. 

After this I looked up, in the spirit, and saw a giant being standing over me. Now, it feels as if I can feel it with me always. The moment I saw this figure I have been extremely empowered, content, and healed.

Meditation,'Suffering Hell - At peace with the worst' Meditation,"This contemplative meditation is useful for those wanting to bring peace with the psychic fears of the body/mind. Besides the fear of death, the fear of perpetual suffering, fear of unending madness, of forever being trapped can also be lodged in the human psyche.

This contemplation should be done with an attitude of surrender. **Please note it will bring strong intense fears, your discretion is advised.**

&amp;#x200B;

Here it goes:

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine forming a bubble of radiant light all around the circumference of your body.

Visualize radiant light all around you, a warm glow and a protective, safe shield.

Do this now.

*(this is an important part, do not skip)*

&amp;#x200B;

This glow will stay with you for the entire duration of this contemplation.

You are held and supported all the way. You are actually safe.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I am inviting you into the hell realm.

The following steps will guide you in a hell realm state.

You can stop now, but if you wish to continue, make the intention to go all the way.

&amp;#x200B;

In hell, you don't die. Instead, you suffer forever.

&amp;#x200B;

Fire.

Imagine burning fire.

The flames carry intense density.

It feels so thick.

It is raging, and ever consuming on its path.

The fire is approaching you.

It feel ominous.

It feels totally undesirable.

You allow yourself to experience this undesirable moment.

&amp;#x200B;

This fire is about to storm on you and take everything you hold dear to you.

It feels like this fire wants nothing but to make you suffer.

As the fire approaches you, you notice you are about to lose your freedom.

&amp;#x200B;

You are burning.

It burns.

The flames are taking you over

It feels so suffocating.

The feeling feels worse than the burns.

That feeling feels worse than the heat.

So much, so rapid, so heavy

You can't believe this is actually happening

But it is happening.

&amp;#x200B;

Your safety, your freedom, your joy, your hopes, they are all forever gone.

Your mental sanity, your mindfulness, they are all forever gone.

Feel the flames, the screams, the agonizing crushing feeling.

Full despair

Paranoia is now your constant companion.

It feels utterly hopeless, helpless, powerless

Feel it.

&amp;#x200B;

You just want this to end, but can't.

Feel this suffocating feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

You cannot escape this suffocating feeling.

You have only two choice. Resist or Surrender.

This unbearable suffocating fire.

Can you allow yourself to burn in that fire?

Can you surrender, forever?

&amp;#x200B;

Can you allow it?

Stop fighting it

Admit the defeat

I want you to let yourself be burnt

The Way of the Cross, like Jesus Christ

Surrender completely

&amp;#x200B;

Bring the intensity and feel it fully            *(pause here a bit and allow this process)*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The fire is not longer resisted

The fire has overtaken you and you have let go

Simply let go

&amp;#x200B;

The fire simply burns, but there is no you there anymore

&amp;#x200B;

You are no more

Without resistance, there is no experience

&amp;#x200B;

You have totally let go

&amp;#x200B;

The fire burns brightly

&amp;#x200B;

It's just fire

&amp;#x200B;

The fire is actually neutral

&amp;#x200B;

It was your resistance to it that felt so painful

&amp;#x200B;

Now all of your resistance has been dissolved

&amp;#x200B;

You are free, resistance-free

&amp;#x200B;

It feels strangely liberating

&amp;#x200B;

You notice you are still here, feeling more alive than ever before

&amp;#x200B;

The hell was all in your mind, dear one

&amp;#x200B;

You generated it

&amp;#x200B;

Without resistance in life, you can now burn brightly like the sun

&amp;#x200B;

Be this shining light

&amp;#x200B;

You are light

&amp;#x200B;

You are love

You are safe

Meditation,"For those getting into meditation, don't get caught up in ""enlightenment"" or ""awakening"" experiences","It's all an ego trap. There is nothing to change or attain; meditation teaches you that Being-ness is complete and fulfilled, unattached from words of the language you grew up with.

If you want the basic gist of it, ""enlightenment"" or ""awakening"" is simply recognizing awareness. Everyone has it. No one can escape this basic, intuitive sense of understanding that you are alive, that you are living as a human-being, that there is subjective experience, aware, etc. Even if you think of the past or future, or dwell deep into your thoughts, you're still present noticing it. How can you know that you are ruminating in your thoughts when you aren't aware? Thinking is from the present moment, memories are from the present moment; truly nothing exists outside of Here.

Meditation,Feel confused on what to do when I sit to meditate (open awareness vs breath focus),"I've been meditating for around 6 months now. I started out on Headspace which teaches a focus on the breath specifically. However a few months ago I switched to Waking Up (Sam Harris) because I couldn't afford Headspace monthly cost.

What I noticed is they both teach meditation differently. Waking Up doesn't often talk about specific breath focus but rather a kind of ""open awareness"" where you allow all sensations, sounds, visual field and the breath.

I find this open awareness helped me realise that I was trying to focus on the breath way too intensely, like ""reaching out"" for it rather than accepting it. I feel more relaxed when I do this method - but is relaxation the goal of meditation?

I have a different concern with the open awareness way: I worry I'm not actually meditating due to the lack of focus. I just kind of try focus on everything all at once (breath, body, sounds, visual field) but I think it's impossible to actually take it all in at once, so what ends up happening is my attention flicks between all of these things mostly at random - is this a bad thing? Is it even training a lack of focus maybe?

I find now every time I sit down to meditate, I kind of switch at random between these two techniques of breath focus and open awareness, which I feel isn't good as I'm practicing 2 things at once.

I'm sure these are just different techniques rather than right and wrong, but I never know which one to do. Since I'm still very inexperienced at meditation, which is a better starting point? I started meditating for anxiety which I've had my whole life and is quite intense, and also OCD symptoms. I want to reduce these as much as I can, I still find meditation helpful and feel better after, but it doesn't carry on into my daily life unfortunately

Any advice, should I maybe alternate between these two techniques? Or is the answer somewhere between the two? Should I just try lightly focus on the breath and be aware of other things around me as a middle ground between these two techniques?",True,0,1639150857,2021-12-10 23:40:57,,,notevenstarcrossed,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/rdbd4f/feel_confused_on_what_to_do_when_i_sit_to/,1,1.0,feel confuse sit open awareness v breath focus around 6 month start headspace teach focus breath specifically month ago switch wake sam harris couldnt afford headspace monthly cost notice teach differently wake doesnt often talk specific breath focus rather kind open awareness allow sensation sound visual field breath find open awareness help realise try focus breath way intensely reach rather accept feel relax method relaxation goal different concern open awareness way worry actually due lack focus kind try focus everything breath body sound visual field think impossible actually take end happen attention flick thing mostly random bad thing even train lack focus maybe find every time sit kind switch random two technique breath focus open awareness feel isnt good practice 2 thing sure different technique rather right wrong never know one still inexperienced better start point start anxiety whole life quite intense ocd symptom want reduce much still find helpful feel better doesnt carry daily life unfortunately advice maybe alternate two technique answer somewhere two try lightly focus breath aware thing around middle grind two technique,153,56,0,2,25

Meditation,Reoccurring dream / visualisation from when I collapse,"Hi internet!

I'm hunting for someone well versed in the ways of creative visualisation or psychology to explain what it all may mean. I'm often an anxious person. I have a condition which causes me to collapse when my fight or flight response is meant to kick in. 

When I collapse, I dream I'm on a grassy hill which has a shady tree on top and nothing else for miles. It's peaceful. Sometimes there is a picnic table under the shade of the tree and people I love(real or fictional) are there having a picnic. The first few times I've had this dream, I've ran to the top of the hill and, not realising until it was too late, I fell off the edge of a large cliff face towards lava and woke up. I've had this dream so many times, I now greet the people sitting at the table with ""Oh hey guys, have I fainted again?"" and quite faithfully and deliberately, I hop off the side of the cliff to wake up. Another time I saw the delicious picnic all these lovely people are having and I say I want to stay and they tell me I can't stay and to go and jump into the lava.

Due to my anxiety being particularly bad lately, I've been looking into meditation and creative visualisation. I find I can meditation quite deeply but when it comes to creative visualisation, I always, deliberately or subconsciously, am transported back to my grassy hill with a long cliff drop and lava. Even if I try to think of the beach, it's equipt with a sudden cliff face and lava. It stops being peaceful at that point...

Meditation,Having trouble meditating.,"A lot of times when i meditate I constantly feel like im doing it wrong the whole time.

It feels like a lot of times while im focusing on my breathing ill have background thoughts saying things like ""there we go, im doing it"", and then i notice those thoughts and feel like im not focusing correctly since im having those thoughts and its like a constant loop.

Or a lot of times while im focusing on my breathing I'll go on autopilot accidentally where im not necessarily thinking, but im not aware of my breathing anymore if that makes sense.

Meditation,Strange experience,"Hi guys I’m new here. I’ve been practicing concentrative meditation since I was 16, now I’m 20. 
I was really into OBE at the time and really trying hard to getting one but it never happened. Yesterday night I decided to smoke a joint to help myself get relaxed and I put some shaman beats (5hz) on my headphones. 
As soon as I started to concentrate on my breath I felt like the heartbeat was in time to the shaman music. I wasn’t concerned about it , my only thought was to focus on my breath. 
I started to feel some kind of energy around my sacrum ( I thought about the kundalini or the first chakra). 
The energy was getting over my entire body and guys was really pleasant , like an entire orgasm. As more as i focus on the shaman music my eyes were open like I couldn’t close them. The heartbeat accelerated and I started to have some difficult to control my breath. I felt like my eyes were going upside down and they were blinking very fast. I wasn’t feeling my body anymore. The heartbeat was faster than ever before in my life and it scared the shit out of me, i started to get some fear and everything vanished. I got some sleep and wrote the experience down.

Meditation,sinking into the breath vs creating space for thoughts,"hi all,

i’ve been meditating relatively consistently for a couple of years now, with some breaks along the way. 

i’ve noticed that most of my practice has revolved around this idea of sinking all of my attention into the breath. for example i focus on the breath, if i notice that a thought is distracting me from the breath, then i let it go and return to the breath. in this way i have found that i feel like i’m trying to sink all of my attention into the breath, occasionally getting into a trance.

recently i’ve started practising with a different mindset. i actively create space in my mind for thoughts, feelings, etc, all whilst still focusing my attention on the portion of that space that is occupied by the breath. if a thought arises i see it travel through that space and i let it go, returning my attention to the breath. 

i was wandering if anyone else views their practice in either of these ways? are these two different meditation techniques? are they two stages of the same technique? is one better than the other? instinctively, the idea of creating space for thoughts feels healthier, but i want to check if i’m on the right track.

This time, I decided to do a Wim Hof meditation to help me relax. I think it helped, however,  while I was doing it, the area around heart started aching me, so I am not sure if that is a good sign. That's why I am writing this post lol.

Maybe I was just too tense? (I think I am usually/most of the time tense + very introverted, which means I rarely speak to anyone + barely leaving the room/house = maybe all of this together contributed to my present state?)

Meditation,Powerful Guided Practice - Healing Pain,"This guided contemplative meditation is designed to bring those aspects of you that feels most unbearable, in a compassionate and soothing way.

&amp;#x200B;

**As with any practice, if you don't bring 100% intention in this meditation, results will greatly vary.**

Here it goes:

&amp;#x200B;

Place a hand to your heart area

Simply place your hand on your heart area now

&amp;#x200B;

Say to yourself:

""*I allow myself to feel. I allow myself to experience all that I've been hiding from. I allow myself to fully feel and forgive my body*""

&amp;#x200B;

Now, rest the hand, and bring up a situation that has been bothering you the most recently. Recall the situation, person, environment where you were bothered

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine you want to show the scene to someone else, a trusting friend. Imagine your trusting friend can temporarily see through your mind's eye, and you want to show them the situation you were bothered by

Try your best to mentally depict the situation, for your friend wants to fully grasp the situation

What are the sounds, the smell, what do you see, can you get a feel of this situation?

Take your time, and make the situation as clear and lucid as possible for your friend

&amp;#x200B;

Now your friend can see clearly what you went through

You start to notice your friend looks at you with tender compassion. They feel sorry for you. This was evidently a hard experience for you

&amp;#x200B;

With great gentleness on their face, they say to you, ""*I'm sorry, I'm so sorry you had to go through this*""

See your friend feeling for you, as their heart is opening up to you

&amp;#x200B;

You feel vulnerable, and yet you allow yourself to feel this moment

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine your heart area trying to open up to your friend

Simply feel the place of pain, and visualize the chest area where you heart is located beginning to open up

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at your friend, you notice they become full of light. They start to emanate luminous, bright rays of light

It feels very warm and healing

You see one ray of light, coming from the prism of their heart, touching your heart

The gentle touch of their light tenderly kisses your pain

You can feel it

Feel the light and its warmth gently and tenderly kissing your pain

I want you to fully feel the kiss to your heart

&amp;#x200B;

More light of their prism of their heart start to touch your heart

It feels overwhelming and very warm at the same time

Feel the warmth in your heart. It is totally safe

&amp;#x200B;

All of the lights are kissing your pain and immediately dissolving the pain into light

&amp;#x200B;

Keep feeling this process, feel all the thousands of little kisses coming towards your heart

*(take as much time as needed with the feeling process)*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The light loves you

It cares about your hurts

You feel the brilliant light inside your heart

&amp;#x200B;

Now, place your hand back to your heart, say to yourself:

*""May I be loved""*

*""May I be forgiven""*

*""May I be happy""*

*""May I be kind""*

*""May I be at peace""                        (repeat as much as it feels right)*

&amp;#x200B;

Your friend, now full of luminous light, departs, as they are so happy to have been able to assist you

You feel grateful and loved

You are always loved

You are Love.

Meditation,i am afraid. i am struggling.,"i would call myself a beginner on the path of meditation. have been practicing sincerely and with commitment for close to two years now. i am at a stage where i am mindful and present almost all day long. or perhaps flitting between mindfulness and not all day long, with the stints of mindfulness getting longer and longer.

i have seen in my practice, the nature of the self. how the experiencer is constructed alongside the experience and is of the same nature, how it works as a way to make sense of the world.

but i’m finding it hard to let go, as i try and be mindful throughout my day. i find myself twisting and turning attention back on itself to examine how the current moment of mindfulness has gone, a knee jerk reaction that sometimes even gets stronger when i try accept it as a poor habit of mine. a live running judgment of the present moment (or perhaps it runs at a moments lag)

i’m scared of getting stuck inside my head again. i’m anxiety prone and have spent many many years prior in the back of my head trying to control things. i have felt many moments where the mindfulness comes naturally, where a small smile tugs at my lips without my realising, as i watch the beauty of the present moment unfold.

but this thirst in me to make sure things go right holds on very tight at times, and i praxtice alone with no one to really guide me other than my self directed understanding of various texts and videos and lectures etc.  i would very much appreciate any words of advice./",True,10,1638988441,2021-12-09 02:34:01,,,pakmansaad,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/rbxsbo/i_am_afraid_i_am_struggling/,1,1.0,afraid struggle call beginner path practice sincerely commitment close two year stage mindful present almost day long perhaps flit mindfulness day long stint mindfulness longer longer see practice nature self experiencer construct alongside experience nature work way make sense world find hard let go try mindful throughout day find twist turn attention back examine current moment mindfulness go knee jerk reaction sometimes even stronger try accept poor habit mine live run judgment present moment perhaps run moment lag scar stick inside head anxiety prone spend many many year prior back head try control thing felt many moment mindfulness come naturally small smile tug lip without realise watch beauty present moment unfold thirst make sure thing go right hold tight time praxtice alone one really guide self direct understand various text video lecture etc much appreciate word advice,138,26,0,0,0
Meditation,30 days / 30 hours of meditation. I did it !,"Just wanna share my experience with you guys. I'll try to keep it short.

In November I was feeling kind of lethargic. Low energy and low motivation to do things. I'm a nervous type of person and I'm used to have racing thoughts even at night. I previously did something like this but it was more than a year and a half ago. I honestly felt great at that time and decided to stop for obscure reason I don't even remember lol

So I thought, why not, let's give it another shot and see how it goes.

Everyday I would meditate after work around 5-6pm. Did both sitting and lied down meditations. 1 hour everyday.

One thing that I see that is common among meditators is that you often don't feel like you get any benefits from the practice anymore. But when you stop, that is when you realise how much it had a heavy impact on your general health and emotional balance. 

Long story short : I can sleep again. I used to be anxious about not sleeping thus not falling asleep. Even after the first few days I started not even thinking about falling asleep. I would just fall asleep. I still wake up in the middle of the night but I quickly fall asleep again, whereas before I'd find it really hard to do it.

I digest food way better, my emotional balance is great and all of my relationships got improved. 90% of my doubts, fear and overthinking is now gone. The 10% that remains is still kicking my ass sometimes but I can manage it and go on with my day. I don't feel like I'm fighting against myself anymore.

I'm also way more focused and I don't spend a lot of time doing useles stuff like watching too many youtube videos or playing video games when I'm supposed to be an adult. Meditation helped me see clearly again, and see what is good for my health and what isn't. 

But the best thing I want to share with you is that throughout these 30 days I really learned that I can heal myself. You hear everyone telling you that ""you have the answers inside of you"" and this is true. 

I would meditate and I had very intense dreams where I would live again traumatic situations. I remember waking up after one of them and thinking to myself ""this is gone, I'll be able to move on now."" 

And so I did.

In the past I tried many different things to get better and find healing. But meditation was all I needed. Suffering is not gone. Anxious thoughts are still there. But I've learned that meditation is not about emptying your mind but  learning to live with yourself. Your mind is like your roomate. You can either be fighting against him or be at peace with him. No matter what you'll do he'll still be here, so why not loving him?",True,24,1638987873,2021-12-09 02:24:33,,,croisciento,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/rbxl1s/30_days_30_hours_of_meditation_i_did_it/,241,0.98,30 day 30 hour wan na share experience guy ill try keep short november feel kind lethargic low energy low motivation thing nervous type person use race thought even night previously something year half ago honestly felt great time decide stop obscure reason even remember lol think let give another shoot see go everyday work around 56pm sit lie 1 hour everyday one thing see common among meditators often feel benefit practice anymore stop realise much heavy impact general health emotional balance long story short sleep use anxious sleep thus fall asleep even first day start even think fall asleep fall asleep still wake middle night quickly fall asleep whereas id find really hard digest food way better emotional balance great relationship improve 90 doubt fear overthinking go 10 remain still kick sometimes manage go day feel fight anymore way focus spend lot time useles stuff watch many youtube video play video game suppose adult help see clearly see good health isnt best thing want share throughout 30 day really learn heal hear everyone tell answer inside true intense dream live traumatic situation remember wake one think go ill able move past try many different thing better find heal need suffer go anxious thought still learn empty mind learn live mind roomate either fight peace matter youll hell still love,215,73,0,4,28

Meditation,Is that normal in meditation ?,"Hi everyone

I start meditation for my anxiety which is fixed on the fear of losing control of my thoughts. 

In fact, I really have a hard time because when I start to be in silence my mind races and sometimes my thoughts seem uncontrollable and random, they go from word to word, from a snippet of sentences that m 'said a friend or one that I heard on TV / radio, to a sound / voice / music, to an image, a scene, a memory etc ... 

Anyway in general I start to feel very uncomfortable and I stop meditation to avoid this feeling of loss of control.

Does anyone experience the same thing while meditating?
Is it okay to take this as normal chatter of the mind? 
Do you have any advice for me?

Meditation,What is this insight?,"Hi, I just wanted to share this as I have yet to find a term for what this kind of insight is that I had 5 years ago.

It’s a long story but I’ll make it short:
I’ve had recurring anxiety phases and 24/7 derealization most of my life.
5 years ago I started getting into meditation and spirituality.
The daily practice MASSIVELY reduced my stress levels and mind chaos.
~3months in I had another anxiety/ocd attack. It started with obsessing over the inherent meaningless of things, then free will and finally worrying that I might develop depersonalization.(this was fueled by my intense research into noself etc)

So I began obsessively „searching for“ the self 24/7 in my every day experience. this was accompanied by extreme fear.
After a few months of this, I suddenly had a shift in my visual perception.
Instead of me being „here“ and the world being „there“, suddenly there was just the world and no „see-er“.
I wasn’t merged with the world but the „I“ that’s looking was gone.
It’s like a shift in perspectice, once you’ve seen you can’t unsee it.

I directly saw that there is no „I“ and I can still see it to this day, although when I don’t focus on it, I don’t feel like I don’t exist rather than feel like i exist. But I can always tune into it. 

However, there is no sense of joy or bliss or anything associated with it. But I’m also not afraid of it anymore. It’s just an observation.

This breakdown 5 years ago caused a fullblown anxiety disorder and I’m still super bad to this day. But that’s largely just a clinical issue and not a dark night I’m sure.
However, I would like to have a name or something for the insight I had.

Meditation,Visions during ‘life purpose’ meditation,"New here but not new to meditation.

I’ve recently been practising some meditation to find my life purpose, what my life path is leading me to and have started having visions and voices during my meditations. The visions below are over my last 3 sessions. If anyone could give any insight to the following sights and meanings, I’d be so appreciative! 🙏 

- large image of an eye
- large bright red beating heart
- shoe/boot
- vision then cuts to a glass dome around me, with a happy, seemingly kind man who makes me feel warm, tapping gently on the glass saying ‘I’m here!’

- vision of the sentence ‘WE WILL HELP YOU’ which then starts being chanted
- soft female voice starts saying ‘help 100 souls’
- I then saw the colour orange, which morphed into an orange tree. I see my hand reaching up to gently take one
- vision of large blue/black triangle 

- chants of ‘you are on the right path but you are not there yet’ then a vision of a path through a forest. I follow the path which then starts leading uphill, I see about 5/6 women with soothing faces in brown, flowing dresses beckoning me up the hill through the forest 

Any insight from you guys would be great! I’m finding it hard to recognise whether I’m reading into it them too much!

Meditation,No ground,"It is becoming uncomfortably clear to me, that most (all?) of my thoughts, emotions and desires, are habits that I have learned at some point in my life. They are created from habit in the moment, and often used to impress other people. With the goal of feeling respected, wanted, useful, admired, loved. For instance; the other day, I became annoyed with my baby son. I said some curse words, and I could clearly see that it was my big brothers voice. I was trying to act like I have seen him act, feel like I believe he would feel. I have a deeply ingrained belief that my brother is ""right"", and I am ""wrong"" (which is a whole story in itself). I realized that I don't have any need to be angry. It is not ""my"" anger, and there is no need to act it out, fight it, or do anything with it.

This happens with a lot of my feelings, in some form or other. And I don't know what to do any more, don't know what to feel or think or believe. The idea that these thoughts, feelings and actions are ""mine"", is crumbling. My practice is also changing. I am less interested in focusing on the breath, to the exclusion of all else. And more interested in Seeing what is here. Feels like the ground I have been standing on, is simply not there any more. Even the discomfort of having no ground to stand on, is something I have learned; it is not mine.",True,2,1638953058,2021-12-08 16:44:18,,,flezk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/rbmvew/no_ground/,1,1.0,grind become uncomfortably clear thought emotion desire habit learn point life create habit moment often use impress people goal feel respect want useful admire love instance day become annoy baby son say curse word clearly see big brother voice try act see act feel believe feel deeply ingrain belief brother right wrong whole story realize need angry anger need act fight anything happen lot feel form know know feel think believe idea thought feel action mine crumble practice change le interest focus breath exclusion interest see feel grind stand simply even discomfort grind stand something learn mine,123,57,0,0,15
Meditation,New technique: If you feel bored sitting in Lotus posture read this:," Good day! Gonna start on how I am reaching a meditative state of mind.

In the mornings I do simple hatha yoga stretches for 10-15 minutes, 

then a long walk in a forest park for 60-90 minutes, 

or in the summertime I add longboarding, or in the wintertime sliding downhill over snow on a sledge. 

Any sport that raises awareness and practice balance is a very good addition. 

For the start, you can practice 'Shavasana' (and a few hatha yoga asanas) and a long walk.

You can run to release tension, but please choose the right shoes, surface, pose.

It's not just mental anxiety, it's physical anxiety. 

Observing thoughts and letting them go is a must. 

You can have important thoughts and can't let them go too

\- write them down in short summary and let them go. 

Eventually (with some practice) there won't be any thoughts when you don't need to.

While stretching, walking, running, etc you can have thoughts, yes.

But while doing that you can still practice thoughts observation, not engaging with them and letting them go.

So, when physical and mental anxiety goes away, you got to a meditative state.

State of silence: 

Awareness. Sensation. 

Feeling. Intuition.

Insight.

Just to go and sit for 10 minutes in the lotus pose is hard even for those who practice 20 years of meditation.

And recently monks start to explain what walking meditation is.

You can't walk with full awareness when you are pissed off.

When your angry boss/colleague/partner/etc have put you off the balanced state.

When you practice rituals and practice 24 hours a day - as monks do - yes, you can do it.

For business people, for people in stress like me. Like you. Please read the above from the beginning one more time.

Your muscles are in tension. Your mind is in tension.

You can't sit down and meditate for 10 minutes. It's just an impossible task.

So what do you do instead? Release the tension. Yoga, sports, observation/mindfulness. 

And get into a meditative state of mind.

After stretching/walking/running/longboarding/etc and letting all thoughts go meanwhile -&gt;

you can get into a meditative state and sit in a lotus pose or start mindful-aware walking. Or dance. Or sing.

You can't do it at once. It's simply impossible unless you are a monk with monk people around you.

And thus you can add meditation everywhere in your 24 hours day.

  
What else I forget to tell here?

Reflection. Yes, reflecting on a way we think is important.

There's a wonderful book by Daniel Goleman - ""Destructive Emotions"".

We need to reflect on how we perceive/judge the world/people around us.

That is further practice and yes, part of a meditative mind.

Such notions as gratitude, forgiveness, compassion come naturally

when you are relaxed and joyful. And naturally, a person starts to practice those.

There's no sense in to do like and saying: ""I am compassionate"", ""I am loving"", etc.

Stop doing this. Get into a meditative state. Reflect on yourself as a human being after meditation.

Compassion will come into your life. Without programming yourself with mantras. Mantras can be good too.

These ideas are not mine. Active/passive meditation is best described here,

by Osho meditation center - it is called dynamic meditation: [https://youtu.be/sbfVcigkNao](https://youtu.be/sbfVcigkNao)

Here go 2 videos, where I show what I am talking about, 

have a nice practice, and let your meditation Not be ""Lotus posture"" boring! 🙏

I have been recently meditating. I mostly started cuz I read how it helps with anxiety and negative thinking and I am kinda always overthinking and anxious.

Part of all this anxiety and despair is cuz I don't feel comfortable around the people I'm with and have hence moved away from them and am trying to work on myself and improve lil by lil.

Staying alone, I often feel lonely and sad and I read how loneliness is a big problem in our society. But then, there are monks like Milerepa and others who went to the mountains and lived alone for years and achieved enlightenment.

So some people get sad and depressed with loneliness while being alone cuz maybe we are social beings while others have achieved enlightenment and lived in bliss while being alone. So what do you think made the difference in these two kinda humans' lives ?

What followed shortly after that amazed me. I've had psoriasis outbreaks on my face for the last 15 years and nothing I did helped it. Now it completely stopped and I have 0 symptoms. I never thought it would end as it's a genetic disorder so you can imagine my astonishment.

There were no other factors I can think of that could have influenced this miracle so I attribute it to meditation. Another reason I think that is because I notice other benefits from it. I always thought these benefits were ephemeral but they are viscerally palpable to me at this point.

Meditation,Zen Meditation - Three Step Process,"Note: This article was pulled from The Japanese Zen Buddhism Page of Stanford's Philosophy Encyclopedia. I'm posting it because It gives a good overview of what meditation is, and the steps in the meditation process. If you are just beginning a meditation practice, it might be a worthwhile read to help fill in some knowledge gaps you may have in your picture of the process. The full article can be found at:https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/japanese-zen/#ThePra 


&gt;When one engages in Zen meditation, Zen recommends that its practitioner follow a three-step procedure: adjusting one’s body, breathing and mind. The practitioner follows these adjustments in the order mentioned when he or she begins. When concluding a sitting session, the procedure is reversed so that he or she can return to an everyday standpoint. We now briefly explain these three steps in the order mentioned.

&gt;3.1 The Adjustment of the Body
Generally speaking, the adjustment of the body means to prepare oneself (one’s mind-body) in such a way that one can achieve an optimal state of being free. To do so, the practitioner needs to have a proper diet, engage in appropriate physical exercise, and avoid forming habits contrary to nurturing a healthy mind-body condition. Specifically, however, when Zen mentions the adjustment of the body, it has in mind seated meditation postures. There are two postures which Zen recognizes: the lotus-posture and the half-lotus posture. A long Zen tradition takes them to be effective for stilling the mind and dissolving various psychological complexes and psychosomatic disorders. However, if a lay practitioner cannot at first assume these postures, they can be substituted initially by sitting on a chair with the spine straight, as it can bring about a similar effect. The adjustment of the body is necessary for the practitioner in order to experience the practical benefits of doing meditation.

&gt;3.2 The Adjustment of Breathing
The benefits of Zen meditation are closely tied to the practice of breathing. Generally speaking, Zen doesn’t recommend any complicated, strenuous breathing exercises as in Yoga. Zen’s breathing exercise is called “observation of breath count” (sūsokukan). In this exercise, the practitioner counts an in-coming breath and an out-going breath. Before counting the breath, the practitioner breathes in through the nostrils and breathes out through the mouth a couple of times. Then one starts counting breaths, but this time breathing in through the nostrils and breathing out through the nostrils. The breath count is performed while performing an abdominal breathing: one brings in air all the way down to the lower abdomen, and breathes out from there. This exercise has the effect of infusing one’s mind-body with fresh life-energy and expelling a negative toxic energy out of the practitioner’s system. For this reason, it must be done in a place where there is ample ventilation. A key to performing breathing exercises successfully is just to observe the in-coming and out-going breath.

&gt;Though these are simple instructions, they are difficult to execute because the neophyte tends to become distracted. Present concerns, worries, fears, and past memories often surface. Zen calls them “wandering thoughts,” which refers to any mental object that prevents the practitioner from concentrating. If one wants to make progress in meditation, this is one of the first things that the practitioner must learn to overcome.

&gt;We now turn to the psycho-physiological meaning of the breathing exercise. Ordinarily, we breathe sixteen to seventeen times per minute, which we do unconsciously or involuntarily. This is because under ordinary circumstances, breathing is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. Neurophysiologically, the center where breathing is controlled is found in the hypothalamus, in the mid-brain. The autonomic nervous system is so-called because it functions independently of our will. Zen breathing is a shift from unconscious, involuntary breathing to conscious, voluntary breathing. This means that Zen meditation is a way of regulating the unconscious-autonomic order of our being. Psychologically, counting the breath trains the unconscious mind and neurophysiologically, it trains the involuntary activity of the nerves that control the function of the various visceral organs. Here we find a reason why Zen recommends abdominal breathing. Nerves are bundled in the upper part of the abdominal cavity, and the abdominal breathing exercise stimulates this bundle. As it does so, parasympathetic nerves still the mind.

&gt;This point is significant in learning to control emotion. Ordinarily, we are told to control our emotion by exercising our will. This is, for example, what Kant recommends. This method works to a certain extent, but we expend our energy unnecessarily in exercising our will. Think of a situation where one tries to submerge a ball in water. When the size of the ball is relatively small, this can be accomplished with little effort. But as the size of the ball becomes larger, it becomes increasingly difficult. Analogously, a lot of psychic energy is required to suppress one’s deeper emotions. There comes a time then when one can no longer hold them down. Consequently, one may end up exploding in various ways, ranging from personal fits to violent social crimes. If we observe a person in an angry state, we will notice that such a person’s breathing pattern and rhythm is shallow, rough, and irregular.

&gt;On the other hand, if we observe a person in a peaceful state, the breathing is deep, smooth, slow, and rhythmical. These examples show that there is a strong correlation between the pattern and the rhythm of breathing and a person’s emotional state, or more generally, state of mind. Zen breathing has a way of naturally heightening the positive correlation between the activity of the autonomic nervous system and emotion. Neurophysiologically, it happens that the center where breathing is regulated and the region where emotion is generated coincide. This means that the conscious breathing psychologically affects the pattern of how one generates emotion, and at the same time it also has a neurophysiological effect on how the autonomous activity of the unconscious is regulated. We will now move on to the third step involved in meditation.

&gt;3.3 The Adjustment of the Mind
Once the bodily posture and the breathing are adjusted, the practitioner next learns to adjust the mind. This means that the practitioner consciously moves to enter a state of meditation. In so doing, the practitioner learns to disengage him- or herself from the concerns of daily life. That is to say, one tries to stop the operation of the conscious mind. However, if one tries to stop the mind by using one’s mind, the mind which is trying to stop itself is still operative. In other words, it is practically impossible to stop the mind by using the mind. Instead, Zen tries to accomplish this by the immobile bodily posture and the breathing exercise. In this connection, it will be informative to know how the practitioner experiences breathing as he or she deepens meditation.

&gt;We can identify three basic stages: initially the practitioner can hear the audible sound of the in-coming and out-going breaths. This is rough and “gross” breathing. This is followed by the second stage in which he or she can feel the pathway of the in-coming and out-going breaths. Breathing at this point becomes “subtle” in that there will no longer be audible sound of the breaths but simply a stream of life-energy. In the third stage there is no more feeling of the in-coming and out-going breaths. When this occurs, the practitioner can settle into a deeper meditational state. Also, it is significant to note that as the practitioner enters a deeper state of meditation, the interval between inhalation and exhalation is prolonged, i.e., the retention of breath is prolonged, as the reduction of breathing activities occurs.

&gt;Meditation trains one to sit face-to-face with one’s self, while creating a psychological isolation from the external world. With this, one enters into an internal world of psychē. As the practitioner attempts to enter the world of psychē, various things start surfacing in the field of the practitioner’s meditative awareness. These are mostly things of concern that have occupied the practitioner in the history of his or her life, or things the practitioner has consciously suppressed for various reasons. Initially, the practitioner experiences recent desires, anxieties, concerns, ideas, and images that have surfaced in his or her daily life. A psychological reason that the practitioner experiences these various things is due in part to the fact the practitioner has lowered the level of conscious activity, by assuming the meditation posture, and doing the breathing exercise. This mechanism is the same as when one has a dream at night. When the level of consciousness is lowered, the suppressive power of ego-consciousness weakens, and consequently the autonomous activity of the unconscious begins to surface.

&gt;However, these desires, images and ideas are distractions insofar as meditation is concerned. This is because in meditation you must learn to focus your awareness on one thing. One must learn just to observe without getting involved in them. That is, one must learn to dis-identify oneself with them. In the process of deepening meditation, one can roughly identify three distinct stages: the stage of concentration, the stage of meditation, and the stage of absorption. In the stage of concentration, the practitioner concentrates, for example on the lower abdomen, establishing a dualistic relationship between the practitioner who is concentrating and the lower abdomen that is the focus of concentration. This dualistic relationship is broken gradually as the practitioner moves into the stage of meditation. The activity of the ego-consciousness is gradually lessened, and the barriers it sets up for itself are gradually removed. When the practitioner enters the stage of absorption (samādhi), the dualistic framing of the mind will be removed such that the mind starts structuring itself non-dualistically. There will be no separation or distancing between an object of the mind and the activity of the mind itself.

&gt;As the practitioner repeats this process over a long period of time, he or she will come to experience a state in which no-thing appears. Zen uses the phrase “no-mind” to designate this state. No-mind does not mean a mindless state. Nor does it mean that there is no mind. It means that there is no conscious activity of the mind that is associated with ego-consciousness in the everyday standpoint. In other word, no-mind is a free mind that is not delimited by ideas, desires, and images. No-mind is a state of mind in which there is neither a superimposition of ideas nor a psychological projection. That is, no-mind is a practical transcendence from the everyday mind, without departing from the everydayness of the world.",True,12,1638924780,2021-12-08

While falling, I remembered, “aren’t I meditating right now?”, continued to have this dream lucidly until I simply opened my eyes.

Meditation,Fairly new at meditating and having trouble identifying my thoughts while attempting to observe my thoughts and empty my mind.,"Hard to describe but when I'm meditating, I can't figure out if my mind is empty, or if it is filled with thoughts in the background. I know that it's not possible to stop thinking, but just how much is too much? If I can't observe the thoughts running in the background, how do I know if I'm giving my mind the rest it needs in this time of meditation?

It's hard to pinpoint what I mean, so I'll explain a bit more. My mind feels silent and calm on the surface but potentially filled with thoughts running and changing rapidly in the background - it feels like I could be thinking of things I'm not aware of while trying to empty my mind and observe. I'm also not actively trying to find my thoughts, I'm just trying to sit there, think less, while focusing on my breath and surroundings, and also notice and let go of thoughts that may arise. I just want to be able to observe my thoughts but I can't seem to identity them.

Meditation,Are there any meditative traditions that emphasize the release of deeply stored physical tension?,"Hello! I have been practicing daily Zen meditation for two years now, and an interesting occurrence that my practice seems to have provoked is the 'bubbling up' and subsequent release of deeply stored tension in my muscles, particularly in the shoulder region. 

It almost feels like entering deeper meditative states allows me to access deep 'pockets' of tension. Then, both during and after meditation, having accessed that tension, I'm able to physically release it. The result of doing so is permanent, and manifests itself not only on the physical level (my posture has improved), but on the cognitive one as well (over time, I have found that my agitated mind has relaxed, and my ego-driven clinging has started letting go).

My question: are there any meditative/spiritual traditions that acknowledge this process of physical release? It has been a fundamental part of my practice, but I haven't encountered any texts that refer to something like this happening.

Meditation,Some Reflections on ADHD and Meditation,"I'll preface by acknowledging this post may be fairly niche and apply to only a small percentage of this subreddit. Nevertheless, I felt like sharing some insights I've come to regarding meditation and its impact on my ADHD. 

I thought Mindfulness and meditation would be my panacea for ADHD. However, as is expected, this was not the case. Thankfully through bouts of therapy, various medications, and meditation I have grown to understand myself and my relationship to this disorder in very interesting ways. 

What I find most striking is the difference between meditating on medication versus off medication. For years people talked about the tranquility practice can bring and for years I felt I was constantly lost thought. I may taste it for a brief moment and then in the next to be completed entranced by a web of thought. I left long sessions (30 mins) feeling mentally drained, constantly pulling my attention back to the present moment. With medication, I find these moments of tranquility last far longer. Detaching from thoughts takes minimal effort compared to what felt like a herculean act previously. The impulse to chase an emotion, or fixate on a distraction, all of it lowered to levels that finally felt manageable. 

Beyond these practical benefits, it is the insights into the nature of my mind which I find truly fascinating. To observe my mind both medicated and unmedicated, I see clearly how powerless I am in controlling what actually enters my awareness. For so long I fought to change the endless chatter in my head as if pure willpower could rewire an entire disorder. Recognizing these stark differences has allowed me to simply focus on my reactions to the chatter. I have also grown a great appreciation for myself, admiration that despite a constant barrage of impulses and distractions I am still able to direct my attention and live a life I find meaningful. It has finally allowed me to be kind and patient with myself, to let go of judgments and conclusions that failed to take the totality of who I am into perspective. In sum, I feel medication gave me the opportunity to quiet my mind so that meditation would be able to help me understand it and accept it.

2) deep body relaxation.  
3) meditative state of mind - doing and living in a ""flow"".  
4) practice: gratitude, forgiveness, and as result compassion.

Meditation,Meditation&amp;cannabis. Starter question.,"Hey this is my first reddit post idk if im even doing it right so I apologize if im in the wrong thread. So im 30 I just started meditating a week and a half ago i started at 20 minutes a day and after 2 days ive been doing about an hour a day 20 minute sessions morning noon and night. Ive really been enjoying it its been becoming more and more of a hobby for me. That being said I am a cannabis user and no I do NOT use it for meditating. My brain would go in a thousand different directions if I did. I was curious on if I can still consume cannabis on a daily basis 2 to 3 times or if this is going to make my meditation pointless. My goals for meditation are to find confidence, clarity, focus, motivation, and to stop alcohol completely and ultimately be a better me for my kids and to find myself.
 I use cannabis for pain and to calm me down when I let my emotions take over as I tend to be impulsive in those moments. Any advice would help i feel ridiculous asking the internet but idk where else to get the answers without paying money for a class I cant afford and i don't have many friends.
My last question is solely about meditating and im sorry if this is a dumb question. As i mentioned before im really enjoying this so i was curious on if its ok to meditate as much as i want in a day or even continue my schedule and meditate randomly when needed/desired throughout a day.

Meditation,Zen or Vipassana meditation?,"Hi everyone! 

I am (kinda) new to meditation. Actually, a few months ago, I tried learning meditation with a teacher (it was basically every morning, an online class). I think it was a form of Vipassana meditation, but it would vary a lot. 
Because of money reasons (I'm a student), but also because I did not like my teacher a lot, I stopped. 

Later on, my therapist started stressing the importance of mindfulness with regards to some of the problems we were discussing. I started using the app Waking Up, and I generally enjoy it, but feel like I'm mainly doing Vipassana breath meditations and I can now do it by myself without being guided by the app. 

To broaden my understanding, I started reading Mindfulness in plain English, which I'm enjoying a lot. However, they make it clear how important it will be to have, at a certain point down the road, a teacher to deepen your practice. A real teacher. 

As I said, because of money, I can't afford expensive courses, and because I'm studying a lot I can't travel for more than 20/30 minutes from my house or university to reach a temple or whichever other place to practice. I found close to my house a very nice temple where they, however, practice Zen meditation and not Vipassana. It should also be free/very much inexpensive. 

It is however a meditation practice different from the one I've been learning. I now wonder what I should do, since it feels like a stupid choice to keep practicing Vipassana if eventually my teacher could be doing Zen meditation. I don't even really understand the difference.

Meditation,Advice,"Hi everyone,

I have been meditating for some time now, but just recently I have been getting into quite deep meditative states. I have noticed however that every time I am entering or in a deep state of awareness, I get too excited that I'm doing it and end up coming out of that state. I'm able to control it, but not for long. I'm usually unable to maintain these states longer than 5 minutes.

Is there any advice you can offer on how to avoid getting overly excited so that I can maintain these states longer?

I would sleep a lot lesser; I googled this and many sources said it was normal, but I didn't necessarily feel really fresh in the morning. I would usually get up with dark circles around my eyes. 

Or I would get up multiple times at night, like 4-5 times and next day would feel like my sleep quality was bad.

I recently tried night meditation again hoping that it would go better but this time I've had the most scariest nightmares.

My names Jay, I thought I might share my experience in hopes it could help someone meditate or even talk to anyone of you about this concept.

Ive been recently been into vibration and how they really do affect us on defferent levels, so I decided to crank the bass on my sub at home placed my home theatre sub against my lounge and I simply sat up against the subwoofer and strapped myself in for a ride.
It was an experience I recommend having I came out half hour later to my body being in tune with this vibration, I simply got up off the floor turned off the music and set up my bed so i was half sitting up and the weight of my body is gone I don't feel the connection between my body and the bed just feeling of floating and one im not thinking im being, my thoughts arnt anything just a lovely breathe in and out.

Meditation,Realisation about meditation,"I realised something I’d like to share and hear some thoughts and opinions.

I used to think meditation was about directing my attention to my body sensation, to sounds, to my breath, to the colours in my eyelids in order to stop my mind from thinking. I thought meditation was all about directing attention away from thought. 

Now I’ve realised that true, deep meditation occurs for me when I don’t focus on any of this. I realise nothing needs my attention, nothing needs my help, the senses are functioning and the “I” doesn’t need to focus on them and so the “I” seems to dissolve into this deeper sense of awareness, I become right on the edge of my perceptions. I am paying attention to nothing in particular but I can feel it all and there is no “I” directing my awareness towards anything. The tunnel of conscious attention disappears and there is a feeling of so much space.

Meditation,No Dreams After Meditating Before Bed?,"No Dreams After Meditating Before Bed?

About a week ago, I got really into meditating before bedtime because it made me feel relaxed and present. I would meditate before bed for about 20 minutes. I was doing this initially to get lucid in my dreams. I was expecting my dreams to get more vivid and eventually me getting lucid in them over time. However, my dream recall went down significantly. I barely remembered any dreams every night after I meditated. So it was having the opposite effect that I wanted.

So I stopped meditating before bed and my dreams went back to normal recall. However, I am confused because I see all of these posts where people are saying how much meditation has effected their dreams and how meditation correlates positively with lucid dreaming. And it makes sense. When you are aware of yourself and your thoughts in the day (or during meditation) you are more aware of your dreams when they are happening, thus leading to lucidity.

So was I meditating improperly? All I did was be aware of my breath for the duration of the meditation.

Meditation,What even is meditation?!,"I know this is a broad question and I am familiar with the term, but to actually practice it I have no idea what to do!! For example, what do I think about while I meditate without encouraging my racing mind to run marathons?

Meditation,Meditation feels painful,"Hey guys I’ve been meditating for a couple of years now, my first year consistent everyday until my second year where a been doing it only a few times a month.

Lately I’ve been trying to restart my meditation routine ( mainly Vipassana breathing meditation) and this time I’ve been alot more honest with myself. 

Truthfully I hate meditation because the boredom feels overwhelming and when I focus on the sensation, I could even interpret it as a mild numb painful sensation located in my body. 

I hate facing it and I don’t understand why I have to sit through it. I’m so tired of this and I’m tired of the empty promises that mediation offers me. I understand that it’s the practice that will eventually cultivate a more peaceful mind, but today I’m seriously tired of it and I’m just don’t and fed up

I had ADHD so this is the only simple thing that I can do consistently but it’s painful and I hate it 

I even cut my mediation short just to write this Reddit post.

When will this stop ? Wtf is this boredom numbing sensation that just doesn’t leave and let me enjoy the presence of being.

Meditation,Face your death - Powerful meditation practise,"( please do this contemplative meditation in a safe setting . *Not recommended if you are about to take a plane*)

\* **If you are going to do this meditation, I want to bring the intention that this is your last meditation you will ever do in your life.  I want you to bring this intensity of intention** \*

Here it is:

&amp;#x200B;

You are on a plane.

Imagine yourself on a plane.

&amp;#x200B;

You are flying at a high altitude in broad daylight.

&amp;#x200B;

You can hear the quiet rumble of the plane's engine.

You can feel the air from the ventilation coming into your nostrils.

Passengers next to you are comfortably watching their TV screens.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at the window, you can see the vastness of the ocean below.

Feel the vastness of the ocean below.

Don't think of it, simply feel.

Small crest of waves can be seen from a far distance.

&amp;#x200B;

It feels calm.

It seems serene.

Suddenly, the emergency alarm goes off.

The beeping sound is resounding all over the aircraft cabin.

You can hear it.

Hear it. Feel it.

The emergency alarm is buzzing.

You feel your heart pounding, anxious of what be.

The plane makes a steep dive. The plane is about to make a nose dive.

The plane is upside down, gravitating down at full speed.

This plane is making a steep dive.

Sheer terror and panic enters your psyche.

Indescribable sensations overtakes your body.

You can't feel your breath, yet you are breathing so heavily.

&amp;#x200B;

Every second feels so slow, yet fast at the same time.

""This is not happening"", you think to yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

This is happening. You are making a nose dive.

This is happening.

Can you allow it?

You have no choice.

Can you surrender to what be?

&amp;#x200B;

Loved ones come to your mind.

You want to tell them how much you love them.

Ambitions that will never be realized comes to mind

Your daily frustrations, your anger, your irritations comes to mind.

Your longings, your wounds, your shame, they all come to flood you.

Imagine all of your mind comes to flood you.

You are about to crash into the waters.

&amp;#x200B;

Let go, there is no more time. You are going to die.

Let go.

&amp;#x200B;

Surrender all of your non surrendered thoughts.

Accept the seemingly unacceptable.

You are about to make a nose dive.

&amp;#x200B;

This is no more time. You are about to brace for impact.

It's so overwhelming.

You allow the overwhelm to take you over.

You are allowing the feeling to take you over.

Can you completely let go?

Let go.

You are going to die.

Meditation,Meditation advice,"My whole life I haven't been able to escape the unavoidable feeling of what psychologists call dissonance, or how i describe as feeling separate from the inside out. My conscious acts were constant attempts from within, to fit into the others around me until I fell into an attitude of hate towards my small town. My parents are in their early 40s and im 24, growing up and growing up as latchkey kids, i was never included in anything my two brothers did, and always felt excluded at home until my parents arrived home later typically 8 pm. My attempts became less and less in school as i found 2 friends, I soon began smoking pot younger than most kids start, and was trying psychedelics throughout the end of high-school. 

It wasn't until college when I did my very first trip by myself, in complete darkness, did I close my eyes and meditated and for the first time ever in my life did united with anything. I felt a sense of oneness that was blissful and yet fleeting. I knew it the second it began that it would soon go away. I cherished it and soon(?) later I came down. I then later began to abuse this drug until I came to the realization that this must be sustainable somehow through other means. 

I soon then began studying bhuddism and Hinduism with great interest to their accuracy in different states of mind that I attained through different psychedelic drugs. It was then  through so many different gurus, enlightend beins, and other disciples, that I read about, i came to the realization only through meditation will I be able to sustain such a bliss. Which I come now to attribute to God. 

I've come to so many realizations only to then realize that I use my mind too much, and that meditation has proven to be difficult for more than 10 minutes. I can't seem to calm the mind, let alone on a day to day basis working HVAC, with college debt. I've been meditating everyday for 3 weeks for 5-10 minutes, and I can't seem to notice when I'm almost falling asleep until it happens.

Meditation,"If you find that Meditation is too hard , or you cant calm your mind.”","Unlike many other endeavors in life, the success of our meditation efforts depends entirely on our attitude. It doesn’t matter how much skill we have or how much we’ve practiced meditation; if we go into it without strong expectations or an attachment to rigid goals and timeframes, then meditation can be a success.

Meditation is not a thing; it’s a process. This process brings several benefits, but it is also its own benefit. The key is to learn to enjoy the process. Practice letting go of self-criticism, comparison, and expectations as soon as they arise. Once you figure out that meditation is not an achievement to collect, you may enjoy the process more.

People often feel that meditation is hard when they believe they should be fighting their thoughts or actively trying to empty the mind (Harris, 2014).

Mindful meditation is more about noticing thoughts when they enter the head and noticing again when they pass, without getting too attached or drawn into them.

There is no fight, repression, or forcefulness about meditation. Fighting with thoughts will simply strengthen them and lead us to an agitated state. With gentle refocusing, the mind can slowly calm down.

Meditation is simply the process of continuously regulating our attention. The mind may empty as a result, but holding on to that expectation or working toward it as a goal can make easy, relaxed mindfulness more elusive. Rather than trying to “empty the mind,” mindfulness meditation involves placing our attention on a single point, moment after moment. With practice, mindfulness can leave us in a calmer and more sable and enlightened state (Harris, 2014).

When someone tells you they don’t meditate because it’s too hard, give them this mental exercise:

Imagine you are trying to get some work done, and suddenly some music starts playing next door. You can hear it clearly, but you can’t do anything about it, so you try to “stop hearing” it. The more you try to stop hearing it, the louder and more obnoxious it seems. However, if you make an effort to focus your mind on something else, you will eventually find that you forgot all about the music.

Don’t think about emptying the mind or making it quiet. Simply follow the meditation instructions and let everything else be.

Some people believe that they need to start with a quiet mind to meditate. They’ll say, “My mind is too restless; there is no way I can meditate.” Does that reasoning ring any bells?

Yet, this is like saying that being fit is a requirement for going to the gym.

Having a “calm mind” is not a requirement for meditation. In fact, having a restless mind is even more reason to meditate.

When you meditate for a while, you will realize that nobody has an inherently calm mind.",True,66,1638815847,2021-12-07 02:37:27,,,AcanthocephalaOwn279,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/rae9z4/if_you_find_that_meditation_is_too_hard_or_you/,1,1.0,find hard calm mind unlike many endeavor life success effort depend entirely attitude doesnt matter much skill much weve practice go without strong expectation attachment rigid goal timeframes success thing process process bring several benefit benefit key learn enjoy process practice let go selfcriticism comparison expectation soon arise figure achievement collect may enjoy process people often feel hard believe fight thought actively try empty mind harris 2014 mindful notice thought enter head notice pas without attach draw fight repression forcefulness fight thought simply strenhen lead u agitate state gentle refocus mind slowly calm simply process continuously regulate attention mind may empty result hold expectation work toward goal make easy relax mindfulness elusive rather try empty mind mindfulness involve place attention single point moment moment practice mindfulness leave u calmer sable enlighten state harris 2014 someone tell hard give mental exercise imagine try work suddenly music start play next door hear clearly anything try stop hear try stop hear louder obnoxious seem make effort focus mind something eventually find forget music think empty mind make quiet simply follow instruction let everything people believe need start quiet mind theyll say mind restless way reason ring bell yet say fit requirement go gym calm mind requirement fact restless mind even reason realize nobody inherently calm mind,215,68,0,0,1

Meditation,Treat mindfulness like snacking? Idea that came to me today.,"I'm new to mindfulness and my brain is extremely distracted. Having very hard time focusing. 

The idea that I got today was, to treat mindfulness like snacking. What I mean by this, is that due to stress, I want to snack all the time. Like eat some peanuts or cashews while watching a movie. 

 Every time when I do something and my brain is all over the place, I bring my attention back to the breath and me being present, metaphorically speaking as if I am throwing a cashew nut in my mouth.

Meditation,How do you integrate meditation into your daily life?,"Hey Guys, (A trigger warning before you might read this. This text contains a description of anxious problems)  
I started meditation this summer because I realized my focus, stress resistance, and confidence is often at a very low level. Especially, since the normal life restarted (after all these lockdowns) I am often uncomfortable in society. This is really hurtful because in general, I was always a social person. I started meditating regularly. But mostly, this just gives me a boost during the time I am doing it. I even went to a Zen session and felt very calm and mindful during and after it. But again, the effect was not so long.  
Now, I even had 2 panic attacks in the past. When I am having a weak day, easy things like putting in a Bankcard, keys in a door, or drinking a full coffee make me tense when I feel watched by people I know. An uncomfortable, strong, destructive feeling is developing in the minutes before I am about to do one of these normally easy tasks. I realized that mindful breathing can be helpful when I realize it early enough and focus on the body. I just stopped two arising attacks this way last weekend :) However, for now, this is still a lot of work and it still doesn't help against the normal sadness about the fact that my body is not as confident as it used to be. So I asked myself what is the point of the mediation sessions when I am in my safe space at home and anyway calm (for example in my bedroom after waking up). I don't think it is practical to say when I meet people; sorry I might seem to be a bit absent during the first 10 minutes, I have to calm a weird illusion before my body doesn't see this situation as a danger anymore. I know meditation is not a self-improvement tool and pressure and expectation will not help at all. But I still asked myself if some of you have ideas on how to adapt the benefits of mediation into daily life.

Meditation,Purple snake in the 3rd eye while meditating,"I stopped meditation last spring due to the lack of ability to open any of the chakras. I tried listening to guided meditations and music, but nothing worked. It took me few months to work on the heart chakra that was blocked for over 2 years. It finally opened in Oct/Nov of this year.  

I'm a very compassionate person that loves humanity. I discovered the bliss of feeling everyone's happiness and pain. It doesn't affect me negatively when I sense the people's pain.

However, last Saturday I woke up feeling the same as the previous months with anger, which is not in me. I decided to meditate for the first time in month. It was an hour meditation for the sole purpose to reopen my heart chakra. I focused on the area and imagined a green light pulsing around my heart, which then radiated around my body. My body vibrated. I had images that I wasn't in control of. The first one was a scene from a movie (American History X) which I haven't watched in over a decade. It was the scene when the main character, who was a racist, had to partner up with another person that is from a different race. And he learned compassion and love as they became good friends. As I pictured that scene, all I felt was love. 

Then I decided to link all te chakras up starting from the root. And as soon I got to the 3rd eye, I started tapping that area with my fingers for 5 min. As soon as I stopped, my whole body had this boost of euphoria and I started laughing out loud. As soon I calmed down, an image of a purple serpent popped up. It was in a box located where my 3rd eye is. The snake was small and it had its head sticking out of the box as if it was going to get out. But it never did. I tried to focus on it, but then the meditation had to be stopped because of the time.

Meditation,"Seeing weird, bad things during meditation","Hi, everyone! 

Last night, when I was meditating, I started seeing things. Usually, when I see things in the eye of my mind or hear them, they are nice thigs, or kinda like clouds or a mist, or kind words (it doesn't always happen). However, as stated in the title, last night was a little weird. These weird, deformed faces with enormous mouths and sharp triangular teeth keept appearing and making sudden movements towards ""me"", as if attacking, and I also saw some more or less skeletal faces that looked as if they were made of intermittent white neon lights. There was one figure of a blue boy who was falling into the black void, and he looked 3D, like in one of those old movies with  a very early 2000s 3D animation. I just want to clarify that I was not creating these thoughts conciously, as I was already deep in a meditative state, and I got sometimes startled by the apparition of the faces. Is this normal? Has anyone else had something similar happen to you? Any idea as to what that might be or mean? Honestly,  if I'm writing this post is because I got very scared and I could use some guidance.

Meditation,Meditation “IS NOT” doing meditation nor is it a means to an end …,"Just sharing what I have learned from study and my own practice- so my apologies if it looks to come from a place of “should vs shouldn’t” …the moment we place the act of meditation of trying to achieve an end state - we are not in a place of what I believe meditation to be.  Don’t get me wrong , the practice has known benefits but this is not why we “do” it. Also, while it is said to be of “no mind” and is true - this idea can set an improper expectation. Mediation is to learn to observe all thoughts without attachment and judgement. Not to be in a state of temporary bliss as this is in of itself contrary to learning to the idea of non attachment to craving and aversions.  

I dare to say that it seems to be a common western society practice to co-opt many tools such as yoga, meditation etc to “feel” a certain way - to “be” happy. But once we understand that the power is in observing the mind - not silencing it can we understand and thereby achieve higher awareness and become less reactive to situations

Meditation,Are humans conscious?,"last year in December when I began truly meditating seriously, the thought came to me that “thought is derived from association of the stimulus”. There are networks of association between stimuli that impart information to the individual. The networks refer to specific stimuli, novel stimuli get organized to previous networks and placed within those networks.

So just recently the question of whether humans are conscious, comes from this previous idea. 

The idea is that well, if thought builds into previous networks, then it’s not novel. So the individual isn’t experiencing novel “consciousness”. I apologize for not being able to clarify this more clearly, I’m still trying to wrap my head around this idea 

so the thing that scared me was that this consciousness this that I am currently operating, you as well, is simply not an individual thing in itself. It’s just butter on bread. Not butter by itself 

and so all humans you interact with are simply things just reacting to their environment. There is no consciousness 

or maybe consciousness starts when you realize this…

Meditation,Expanding consciousness as a newbie,"Hello everybody this is my 1st time on the forum, lately my body has been developing healthy habits on its own after a bad break up. Strange but it’s finally led me to mediation. I was wondering how I could expand my consciousness without any hard drugs because I noticed my fervor for life has significantly waned. I don’t care for the news, don’t enjoy learning anymore, and realized I had a fixed mindset over these past few years. 

Now I’m trying new hobbies and activities to keep me engaged and try to adopt a growth mindset. In terms of mediation… is there a specific time and frequency I should be meditating to expand my horizons? I want to wonder about the world, become inquisitive again, and love learning again. I just almost 30 minutes and I definitely feel different. Are there milestones I should be annotating? Usually I let the thoughts / feelings come and go, while telling myself “let it pass.” I also do a lot of self talk such as “nobody controls you and you control nobody” it’s very freeing actually.

Meditation,The Inner Animal: Anyone else have the experience of meditation connecting you with your more aninamalistic side?,"Disclaimer: this post contains discussing feelings of sexual urges, and has been tagged as NSFW.

I'm a guy who's 21, and is in nursing school.

Recently, as I've meditated and learned to come into the feelings in my body, I can feel when I am present that I am more in touch with my more raw ""animalistic"" side and feel more physically attracted to people. The other week I took THC and was in basically a meditative state with a girl I met on Tinder, and I felt much more alive, in my body, and a much more physical sense of power in a way.

I also feel that as I exercise and meditate I feel more ""awake"" or ""alive"" and feel the urge to do things physically that are fun or competitive just for the sake of doing so, in a way being more in touch with my masculine side of aggression, strength, and the desire to compete, whereas previously in my life (athletically and sexually) I've been less dominant or aggressive, more calm and compassionate, and more in my head and disconnected from my feelings in that way.

I was wondering if feeling more in-tune to the almost ""animal"" side of us is normal? And also if it is how that works or is thought to function? If there is something about the modern world or our thinking brain that disconnects us from some of our more raw urges that can be a healthy part of our lives?

I know normally meditation and psychedelics put people more in touch with their spiritual and/or compassionate sides, and I feel it does that for me too, but I find it makes me feel more awake to sensations I have pushed down or ignored as well such as sexual desire and physical aggression. And then I feel more awake and alive even when I'm not high or meditating since I am more awake to them and aware of them.",True,4,1638747838,2021-12-06 07:43:58,,,smartcow360,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/r9svoy/the_inner_animal_anyone_else_have_the_experience/,1,1.0,inner animal anyone experience connect aninamalistic side disclaimer post contain discus feel sexual urge tag nsfw guy 21 nurse school recently learn come feel body feel present touch raw animalistic side feel physically attract people week take thc basically meditative state girl meet tinder felt much alive body much physical sense power way feel exercise feel awake alive feel urge thing physically fun competitive sake way touch masculine side aggression strenh desire compete whereas previously life athletically sexually le dominant aggressive calm compassionate head disconnect feel way wonder feel intune almost animal side u normal work think function something modern world think brain disconnect u raw urge healthy part live know normally psychedelics put people touch spiritual andor compassionate side feel find make feel awake sensation push ignore well sexual desire physical aggression feel awake alive even high awake aware,172,45,0,0,18
Meditation,What to meditate on and why,"Hi dear friends, hope your practice is going well for you.

I have increasingly felt like asking my community, what I could or should be meditating or focusing on.

I can easily drop into a state of calm and aware focus these days. That's great. But then there arises what I consider to be the politics of meditation... like, what do I (or anyone) do with this precious state? And for what ends?

As someone interested in Buddhism, the general advice seems to be to cultivate bodhicitta - the dedication to the liberation of all beings. And then, the idea of using meditation analytically, ie. to see deeply into this or that problem, also arises. And so on.

So I'm delighted to be at the forefront of using meditation in a variety of modes, but I guess my question is how best to time-share those modes, if I wish the best for myself and all other beings?

Meditation,Meditation help on jealousy and inappropriate infatuations,"I'm struggling to stay present generally because of an inappropriate infatuation I have with someone, and the complications and jealousies caused by it affect me all the time.

I want to use meditation/awareness and noting to help me be more accepting and less rejecting of these feelings.

But I'm struggling because the only way for me to proceed and not hurt this person or disrupt their life is to essentially pretend outwardly these feelings don't exist. You might argue I could and should share, but you're going to have to trust me that you wouldn't agree if you had the whole context.

I have been regularly meditating for around a year now and I am journeying down the path to finding my true innate being.

I have just had a very beautiful experience, whilst meditating I usually focus on the breath completely and get into very peaceful states, but thoughts always still invade the mind. Tonight however I got into a state of bliss where I could witness my breath but also I was aware of all of my body parts, every atom of my being.

It was like I was away from my body witnessing my heartbeat and my senses and I got a very warm vibration take over me, like a tingling all over my body.

I had no thoughts or feelings for my 20 minute sitting and I feel like I have finally entered the true meditative state, and it was unbelievable harmony and bliss with the present moment.

Meditation,Question on changing attitude to “the rules”,"When I was at university I did a course on psychology. I remember a lecture on traits of psychopaths, one of them was “lack of care towards accruing debt”. I think I took it the wrong way, as if it was saying “those in debt are psychopaths”.

As with most people, I moved to a major city after university and started working my way up the ranks. And, like most people, accrued a horrendous level of debt. Although I didn’t actively think “I’m a psychopath” I felt a tremendous amount of shame. I suffered a nervous breakdown in 2013 and my creditors - American Express and the royal bank of Scotland - totally shafted me. As soon as I was out of work they hit me with demands and default notices. I defined a payment plan and have been paying these debts off since then. 

Funny thing is I am now in a position to comfortably pay off these debts, but I’m refusing. You see, I had a sort of conscious awakening in 2014 where I realised that society encourages us to get into debt then judges us when we can’t pay it back, for whatever reason. 

I started meditating and I came to this realisation. 

In addition, when using my car in London it’s almost impossible to avoid getting a ticket for some arbitrary rule. I was forced to use a bus lane when a cyclist swerved in front of me and TFL are still demanding the money. I’m happily refusing. 

Naturally I’d not seek to break rules, especially if it endangered someone’s safety or caused any sort of harm. But is my lack of care towards things like debt and arbitrary traffic rules wrong?

Meditation,Problems being present after meditation practice,"Hey All,

  
Over the past couple of months, I've been doing meditation for around 20 minutes each morning to start my day. I've experimented with different types of meditations using apps like headspace, calm, 10% happier, 1giantmind. Recently I've been doing mostly single-point focus meditations, where I just use a timer and focus on my breath for 20 minutes, and I've been feeling very focused and ready to go after the meditation session is done. But I tend to have a problem with daydreaming afterward. It seems like I tend to focus more on daydreaming about goals I have, instead of being in the present moment and focusing on my work for the day after my meditation practice. And I also feel like my threshold for patience has decreased. I'll get more irritated by small things people do more so than I did in the past prior to practicing meditation.

Is this something other people have experienced as well? And if so, what advice can you lend to help address some of these issues?",True,2,1638649537,2021-12-05 04:25:37,,,Inner_Public4216,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/r8yakl/problems_being_present_after_meditation_practice/,1,1.0,problem present practice hey past couple month around 20 minute morning start day experiment different type use apps headspace calm 10 happier 1giantmind recently mostly singlepoint focus use timer focus breath 20 minute feel focus ready go session tend problem daydream afterward seem tend focus daydream goal instead present moment focus work day practice feel threshold patience decrease ill irritate small thing people past prior practice something people experience well advice lend help address issue,78,25,0,2,6
Meditation,Reflections from a soundscape meditation,"I recently tried a [soundscape meditation](https://plantimals.org/patterns/soundscape-meditation/) with a group.

The method in short is to start off listening to the sounds of your own breath as you would with a normal meditation, and then progressively increase the breadth of your awareness by moving that listening barrier outwards from your self. As a group exercise, we then came back together to see what common experiences we shared in listening to the sounds of the area we had inhabited together.

We all heard the dry leaves scrape against the ground near where we were sitting. We highlighted the slow, building sound of the wind rushing between the trees, and the sensation when that gust finally blew past where we were. The aim of this exercise was to create an [intersubjective](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-1-4614-6086-2_9182#:~:text=Intersubjectivity%2C%20a%20term%20originally%20coined,%2C%E2%80%9D%20as%20facilitated%20by%20empathy.) experience amongst each other, and in that we succeeded.

During the meditation however, my mind had wandered towards the clock.

Prior to beginning, I had set a timer on my phone as one does so that I knew when to wrap up the meditation and return to the group.

Late in the meditation, enough time felt to have gone by that I wondered if I’d started the timer at all. While it was technically a group exercise, we were seated far enough apart in the environment that one’s individual rustlings or noises wouldn’t disturb another’s.

For a few moments, I felt the anxiety of both not knowing if I’d set the timer, and not wanting to exit the meditation to check and disrupt my flow.

As I attempted to veer from this anxiety and back into some semblance of a blissful state of awareness, I came to the following highdea—*High on life, no ‘ganja necessary.*

This situation I was experiencing was a metaphor for the waking experience of everyone around us.

I was waiting, waiting, waiting, trying to achieve—*something*—and yet **the something that I was waiting to achieve was actually just the end of what I should have been focussing on achieving.**

I heard a metaphor once that meditating is like dancing. The point isn’t to achieve anything at all, the point is to dance.

So it goes with life.

As I came to the conclusion that that damn rectangle in my pocket wasn’t a signal of completing an achievement, but rather an interruption to what I was achieving, my anxiety at having not set the timer began to wane. I fell back into bliss. *If I run over our allotted time, then someone will come and get Ben*—I thought—*But until then, I’m going to enjoy this moment, free of distraction and anxiety for when it may come to an end.*

***BZZZ, BZZZ, BZZZ.***

…less than 10 seconds thereafter.

**The achievement you should cherish is the one that you are currently in the process of achieving.**

Recognize each moment for the achievement that it is and maybe you’ll find a little more peace in your lived experience.

The female I think has conversations in her head because she nods yes and no frequently. 

Because of all this nervous energy and tension, I found myself with my head down playing on my phone, going to my room to take a nap, going on a walk by myself — just anything where I could escape their energy. (I probably seemed like a bad houseguest! LOL.)

Meditation,Twice a day and motivation?,"Hi! I started meditating a few days ago and I LOVE it. I can't wait for meditation time. I have mental health issues and the peace I feel after meditating is very similar to how I feel after taking clotiazepam* (my doctor prescribed it for panic attacks). How common is meditating twice a day and is it healthy? I was also wondering if you guys know of guided meditation I can do after I wake up, especially for motivation. Thanks!

Meditation,Accidental Meditation?,"I am fortunate enough to have a job that allows me to catch a nap in the afternoon most days. 

Most of the time I nap for around 1-2 hours and I am full on asleep. 

However, every now and then something weird happens. I lay down, get comfortable, and close my eyes. However I can't fall asleep. Instead I am fully conscious the entire time. I can hear everything that happens in the house, but I get a strange disconnected feeling. Like it's happening but I am not really there. 

Time also becomes distorted. It might feel like I have been laying down for 15 minutes but when I get up I see that it has been an hour and a half. 

When I get up from these ""awake naps"" I feel refreshed, but not like when I actually fall asleep. I just thought it was a weird light sleep, but my therapist recommended looking into self care techniques and meditation was one of them.

When I read more about meditation it sounded exactly like those weird naps I sometimes take.

Meditation,I'm in a loop and it's hard to increase meditation time. Any tips?,"I meditate usually for 5 minutes. I want to keep meditating like that for 30 day and slowly increase time after that, but I can't get to that number of days. I'm having a streak of around two weeks and there's one day I forget, or something and the streak is lost, but after that one day I come back to meditating. But the streak is lost. One time I tried to increase one minute/day but something happened and I missed a day and had to start over again. They say start small, but I can't get out of it. It's been two months since I started meditating regularly (with a few days of failure) and even made a deal that if I skip meditation day I'll give 5$ to my friend. Even before that I once had 58 day streak of 5 min. meditation, but abandoned it for a week after failure and even had unregular days like one year ago or two of 1h or 30min. meditation. Now that I look back at it I don't know how I managed to meditate for so long (1h or 30min.) - it's so difficult.

Meditation,Braingasm,"I just meditated for about 18 minutes and at around minute 16 till the end I had let go of all thoughts and focused on the sensation in my head/brain. Has anyone ever felt the moment they fell in love with someone? Those explosive feelings inside your chest? That is how It felt in my head today. It kept getting more and more stronger and even spread out to my neck, shoulders, upper back and chest; to the point where I felt it was overwhelming. I then told myself I have to calm down and the sensation started easing off to the point where I stopped meditation.

Meditation,OCD after six months of daily meditation,"I commented this on another post but I wanted to give it its own post as this is the kind of thing I was looking for 6 months ago. I had hit a wall with my ability to cope with my OCD - meds hadn’t worked and I knew why everything was happening but the scale of my constant distress… I couldn’t get a hold of it. So my wife bought me an Eckhart Tolle book* and I looked into meditation, seriously. 

And it has, no bit, been the path to acceptance and freedom for me. For others with OCD (particularly pure O) I wanted to detail how and why:

I have OCD (pure) which I developed 2.5 years ago – reached a point 6 months ago when i was sick of just coping (aka i wasn't having spikes that spawned into panic attacks daily, only weekly) and knew something else had to change.

I've been meditating daily since and it's truly, sincerely helped. I'm not just coping, I'm recovering. My OCD is not gone by any stretch, I have thoughts every day and I will get caught in panics but they are far less frequent.

If it helps this is what it does for me and how I approach it.

- I see meditation as a daily reminder to practice CBT/ACT/ERP, whichever therapeutic process works for your particular fixations. Mine are existential or sexuality/relationship focused, and all I want is for them to stop and to trust myself again. As you know if you have OCD the force of the desire for them to stop only makes it worse. When I meditate I practice accepting the thoughts **without** engaging with them (my compulsion being to try and rationalise with a thought: prove a memory didn't happen, test my response to an imagined situation, repeatedly visualise things to check how i feel etc). Practicing this daily is the best thing I've done for myself. And when I told my therapist about this rationalisation she agreed, which always helps.

- I find affirmations too cluttering for my brain and I tend to argue back against them. I just do meditations where you focus on the breath and allow thoughts to pass by. It's incredibly hard I've never managed to focus on the breath for more than maybe 45 seconds at a time, but the distance it gives you from your thoughts is so valuable. 

- I also like a body scan in the evening to practice focus and letting thoughts pass by, and occasionally a progressive muscle relaxation if I'm storing a lot of tension in my body.

- Doing a daily practice, as well as writing notes (is this past, present or future focused, what is the theme etc) when I feel a flare up coming, has helped me recognise patterns in my thinking. And when I see it is a pattern I can accept this particular flare up as an echo of some time before. There's a really great talk on Insight Timer by Roxanne Pigeon about OCD and the present moment that helped me frame this in a way that is useful: the thoughts are like your past anxieties (real or imagined) throwing rocks at you.

- At first you will question the process. Is it working am I doing it wrong why can't I find peace etc. In my experience it takes much longer for meditation to help outside of meditation if you have OCD. I had good days and terrible days but I was at a point where I knew I had to stick at it. Our brains have patterns that are entrenched in panic and the unlearning is so so hard. But I promise you it is possible. Slowly the painful steel wool that expands in your brain every time you have a thought softens and reduces. I have gone a whole afternoon without thinking about OCD at all now, let alone having thoughts affect me. When I realised I cried with relief.

If you’re looking into it I’d advise starting with small practices a day ( i do mine in the mornings) and with ones that focus on anxiety if you can imo. They are not specifically for us but they better fit the way our brains function. I personally have done the Headspace 'Managing Anxiety' course about 4 times now because it has no spiritual stuff in it (a trigger for me) but speaks directly to how anxiety manifests even if it doesn't really deal with intrusive thoughts or compulsions. I also like insight timer in the evenings – for body scans, Progressive muscle relaxation, and also talks about how obsessive thinking works can be really soothing. I recommend Roxanne Pigeon's ones on Escaping The Prison Of Your Mind.

If you’re here because you did what I did earlier this year (frantically google ocd meditation help etc) know that you are not alone in this! Pure O is so devastating and isolating, you don’t have anything physical to point to so unlearning compulsions can feel impossible, but you are not alone and you can learn to accept it until sometimes you even forget it's there. And when you do it feels like flying.

Meditation,Words of wisdom from theoretical physicist Max Planck.,"&gt;A scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Max Planck

Science (from Latin *scientia* 'knowledge') is ideally a nonjudgmental way of attaining knowledge. Consider the above words of Max Planck (the theoretical physicist who realized energy is quantized). All things pass so that the truth can be revealed. 

To gain the scientific truth of your *existential self*, you must observe nonjudgmentally, and without expectations. With patience, you will see the *false self* pass away and witness the emergence of the *hidden self*. 

&amp;#x200B;

**""A scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light,""**

Disidentify with thought. Don't perpetuate the struggle. 

**""but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.""**

Meditation,The Thought Devourer - Something To Think About,"I like to use the first mantra.

Because it represents the vocalization of an exhale and an inhale , it becomes the meditator's ""thoughts"" and is eventually replaced by the sound, feeling and sensation of exhaling and inhaling, leaving one thoughtless.

I like to think of the process as the Thought-Devouring Oxygenator.

The mantra isn't ""om"" as was popularized in the Op Art movement of the 1960s, the better translation of the Sanskrit is ""au-m"".

au- creates a natural exhale in humans.

Say ""paul"" in a whisper that only you can hear, for as long as you can and longer.

Say ""haul"" in a whisper that only you can hear, for as long as you can and longer.

-m is what you hear and feel as your au- emptied lungs refill completely for the first time ever

Take a deep breath? No, make a deep breath with your mouth closed, gently using your solar plexus and the sound and thought of au- to make room for the inundating -m.

Love the gentle au-, it's your anchor. Make it, hear it, feel it, think it and one day soon it will disappear. Until then, thanks to au-m, benefit from the deepest, non-hyperventilatory breathing possible

To make the process meditative, always begin your au- exhalation just before your -m inhalation is complete. Beginning your exhale just before your inhale is complete will make the gentle process circular and meditative.

au-m, the mantra of our most essential act.

[Start] with 10 or [15] minutes.

Meditation,Rational Justification of the Self,"All reasoning is done in objective terms: to persuade another or ourselves of an objective, universal truth, or else a pragmatic, localized one. Every thought regarding the self works within this realm of reason, and therefore every identification within the mind is an externalized attempt to justify our existence.


The ego is the false self held together by the reasoning mind. Identifications are with concepts: rational arguments which attempt to provide the self with universal, objective, unalienable truth and stability. We want to exist untouchable, and so when we feel that the reasoning for our existence is insufficient or based on shaky ground, we begin our work on constructing more true and stable self-concepts.


But the Self, who we truly are beneath this process, requires no argument for its constant, clear, and inalienable existence. Yet living in this social world, we are burdened with this task of proving to one another that we are valid persons. If we do not give a convincing argument, our identity is dismissed. We can choose to give into this criticism and struggle for external validation of the self, always refining our self concept toward a greater seeming harmony with the hopes we will finally achieve objective grounds for universal social acceptance, or perhaps identifying with our denied flaws out of spite and spiraling into disharmony. 


Both of these choices are insufficient and wholly miss the mark. As we attempt to further refine the ego as valid and true, we attach our self-sense to ever-complex conceptions which forever must be defended from collapse. Flaws are discovered, and fearing the despair of an empty self (i.e. death), are corrected and fixed toward something more stable. 


Flaws however, are ever-present in the rational self. Our disharmonies coexist with our harmonies, and to the extent we deny the realities of these disharmonies from the ego-self, we deny them consciousness and push them into the periphery of our existence. This is the subconscious, the shadow, and in moments of weakness, where we feel we can no longer keep up with the authority of our ego towards maintaining harmony, we may identify with this shadow self out of spite for the ego's authoritarian rule. We deny the righteousness of harmony as pretentious and moralizing, and double down on disharmony in rebellion. The seemingly ever-present existence of disharmony, the truth of harmony always decaying into disharmony, the fact of death at the end of this life, and our orientation towards it, gives this ego a sense of truth and stability. 


Neither paths are sufficient because each denies the reality of the other. Identification with disharmony destabilizes an identification with harmony, and vice-versa. Though both forces are within us, always at play, all of the time, and identification with one over the other -valuation of one over the other- is what divides the whole of our being into fragmented and disowned parts; conscious and unconscious, self and other. We do not destroy dissonance by becoming unconscious of it: it merely serves to blind us. The very act of denying disharmony puts us in a constant state of disharmony (anxiety).


This is the ego process as we experience it, and without this process there is no ego. This process is rendered irrelevant by the recognition that the self is not dependant on harmony over dissonance, social acceptance over non-acceptance, truth over non-truth, perfection over flaw, etc. There is not a single reason that gives our being more reality than another, a single thought, action, or object. All are seen and can be seen by the true Self which is limited by nothing, depends on nothing for it's existence. This Self does not need to be argued for, it does not need to be accepted by another, it is not harmony as opposed to dissonance, as then it would depend on dissonance for its existence. This is not the case; no object to be seen gives the Seer its existence. All objects of form/nature depend on opposites for their existence, i.e. harmony and disharmony, and the ego is yet another object. 


We are not that. We are consciousness which depends on nothing for its being. Abide in this and be free from the anxiety of chasing yourself in external objects which cannot contain you. You know who you are, and now the objects you thought were you simply come and go like the tides. This has been the secret goal all along, and in this recognition itself you see that the journey has ended. ",True,0,1638567305,2021-12-04 05:35:05,,,AnIsolatedMind,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/r89ri8/rational_justification_of_the_self/,1,1.0,rational justification self reason objective term persuade another objective universal truth pragmatic localize one every think regard self work within realm reason every identification within mind externalize attempt justify existence ego false self hold together reason mind identification concept rational argument attempt provide self universal objective unalienable truth stability want exist untouchable feel reason existence insufficient base shaky grind begin work construct true stable selfconcepts self truly beneath process require argument constant clear inalienable existence yet live social world burden task prove one another valid person give convince argument identity dismiss choose give criticism struggle external validation self always refine self concept toward greater seem harmony hop finally achieve objective ground universal social acceptance perhaps identify deny flaw spite spiral disharmony choice insufficient wholly miss mark attempt refine ego valid true attach selfsense evercomplex conception forever must defend collapse flaw discover fear despair empty self ie death correct fix toward something stable flaw everpresent rational self disharmony coexist harmony extent deny reality disharmony egoself deny consciousness push periphery existence subconscious shadow moment weakness feel longer keep authority ego towards maintain harmony may identify shadow self spite ego authoritarian rule deny righteousness harmony pretentious moralize double disharmony rebellion seemingly everpresent existence disharmony truth harmony always decay disharmony fact death end life orientation towards give ego sense truth stability neither path sufficient deny reality identification disharmony destabilize identification harmony viceversa though force within u always play time identification one valuation one divide whole fragment disown part conscious unconscious self destroy dissonance become unconscious merely serve blind u act deny disharmony put u constant state disharmony anxiety ego process experience without process ego process render irrelevant recognition self dependant harmony dissonance social acceptance nonacceptance truth nontruth perfection flaw etc single reason give reality another single think action object see see true self limit nothing depend nothing existence self need argue need accept another harmony oppose dissonance depend dissonance existence case object see give seer existence object formnature depend opposite existence ie harmony disharmony ego yet another object consciousness depend nothing abide free anxiety chase external object contain know object think simply come go tide secret goal along recognition see journey end,359,113,0,0,0

Meditation,How can I help my self hatred?,"I’m pretty new to meditating but I’m not good at keeping it a consistent activity. Today I have been very hard on myself and it’s causing my relationship with my gf to become worrisome to say the least because I do enjoy us being together but my self hatred is making the relationship hard for her. I did a stress guide today (my last meditation was like over 2 months ago) but I think I realized I’m in a constant state of fight or flight because my stress has caused me to be anxious and depressed and I react a lot. I put myself up to very high standards from my childhood and once a problem arises, I get extremely stressed because I have this dream of not any problems happening to me anymore. But I know that I can’t get rid of problems from happening. I know I don’t have that power but I can’t even handle a simple problem that arises and that causes me to hate myself because I expect myself to know that I should be better but I keep feeling like I’m failing. Once I get overwhelmed from feeling, I shut down really hard and I either react really badly or I don’t say anything. I honestly don’t know what I’m trying to say. Today has been extremely hard and I don’t want to lose my relationship over my self hatred towards myself. Whenever she tries to help me with it, I have 20 reasons on why I don’t agree with her positivity and that wears her down. How can I notice patterns of me going down the self hatred route? Once I’m on it, it takes me hours for me to not think like that. I want to stop the self hatred for the relationship and for myself because I’m my own bully and I want to look at myself better because I don’t believe when people tell me good things about me.

Meditation,The Original Mantra And Our Most Essential Act,"Try this, you'll know if it works immediatelyish.

Start with the first mantra and spread out from there. It's not om, it's au-m.

au- creates a natural exhale in humans.

Say ""paul"" in a whisper that only you can hear, for as long as you can and longer.

Say ""haul"" in a whisper that only you can hear, for as long as you can and longer.

-m is what you hear and feel as your au- emptied lungs refill completely for the first time ever.

Take a deep breath?

No, make a deep breath with your mouth closed, gently using your solar plexus and the sound and thought of au- to make room for the inundating -m.

Love the gentle au-, it's your anchor. Make it, hear it, feel it.

To make the process meditative, always begin your au- exhalation just before your -m inhalation is complete. Beginning your exhale just before your inhale is complete will make the gentle process circular and meditative.

Meditation,Visions while meditating,"Hey everyone. I just want to share this experience I had while meditating today.

1. a deep purple skyline
2. washing animal insides in a colander (think like, chicken liver)
3. sand moving (desert, not beach)

These felt different from my mind just drifting off, because a) the pictures came and went instantaneously (unlike drifting off where it's like, I'm thinking about this thing, and then this other thing, and then ...) and b) I could actually see it as if I was there.

Meditation,Looking for advice around being present with anxious sensations during meditation,"Hello,

I'm a relative beginner who is aiming to train my mind to be less reactive to anxious thoughts and sensations in life. Ultimately my goal is that when anxiety arises that I can acknowledge it and then return to the present moment without getting caught up in it.

However I'm challenged currently with the idea of being ""present' with anxious sensations during my meditation sessions - mainly because this is very uncomfortable and I tend to start to focus on them. Typically when I try to be present with the sensations, the anxiety gets worse because I'm suddenly close to it. Then the classic thoughts &gt; sensations &gt; thoughts cycle begins.

Meditation,Shunya Mudra Effects On Circulation,"Hi there! 

I'm hoping someone with experience doing the Shunya Mudra can help me with some guidance. Today was my first time practicing this Mudra during my daily meditation. I held the posture for 22 minutes about 2 hs ago. 

Now all of a sudden I feel tingling in my hands and noticed how the veins on my left hand started to bulge up significantly. I feel as if my hands are numb, specially the left one. My concern is if this is a normal side effect of having practiced the Mudra or if this is something to be cautious about. 

I'm fairly young and have no serious health problems that I am aware of. But these symptoms certainly feel very odd and I can't help to associate them with the practice.

yoga,"Hips are always tight, even with consistent practice.","Hey everyone. I have an issue - it seems that no matter how often I practice yoga and keep on top of my routine, my hips are always tight.

I typically do a 45 minute hips focused routine twice a week that covers hamstrings, lower back, quads and hips. It is very in depth, and features multiple poses for each muscle group. When I am done the routine, my hips feel great and are very mobile. Then I exercise or go a few days between practice, and it’s like I never did the yoga and am back to square one, not even being able to sit cross legged without serious tightness in my hips. 

I train Jiu Jitsu, and hip mobility it critical to the art, so it is important for me that I maintain good mobility however it is frustrating that it seems I make zero progress and am just as tight a year after starting my yoga practice. 

Is there something I am doing wrong? I have tried various routines, I take hot baths after exercise to keep my muscles from tightening up, I stretch after exercise… but I can’t sit cross legged and folding forward while in a seated butterfly pose is impossible. I have been doing yoga consistently for a year and see no progress. I still do it because it feel that it is at least keeping me at a baseline, however I expected that I would have made some progress by now.

yoga,Words of Warning - Forward Fold,"Mods please feel free to remove, I just wanted to share my experience. I was warned on this sub about 2 years ago I would say... and I failed to heed the warnings. Now I am paying for it. 

1.5-2 years ago I commented a pretty innocuous comment praising the forward fold. I said something along the lines of, I'm getting so good with it I can actually crack my back with gravity by simply hanging forward. Another commenter agreed, ""oh yes, it feels so good to reach that point."" But there was one commenter that said, be careful, thats a guaranteed way to get a slipped disk in your lower back if you arent careful. 

Slipped Disc? I lol'd with the confidence of an uninjured 28-29 year old. 

Long story short, I definitely injured my back and its changed a lot of my mobility. The ""progress"" I had been making in yoga is almost all gone and I am back to beginner form poses with lots of bent knees and support blocks. 

Here is how I ignored the signs of injury and kept pressing through until I finally educated myself on anatomy. 

First, I've always had a tight lower back and periodic lower back pain (multiple car accidents). I always thought the bridge and backbend poses would be detrimental so I sort of avoided them or didn't push too hard with them. The way I saw it was, backs arents supposed to curve like that, no way that pressure is good for the spine, me and my liberal arts degree must know so much about osteology.  

Instead I focused on forward folds and always thought I had good form. stretching through the legs, hamstrings, and glutes rather than stretching through the back. I was starting to get really flexible this way and lower and lower to the ground. Then I started to feel the sweet release of cracking your back in foward fold through gravity and I became hooked on this feeling. This is also when I started to feel a warm ""tenderness"" around my lower back which I thought was relieved by the cracking and folding. I loved this feeling so much that I frequently would fold forward as I felt it relieved this tender feeling which seemed to be increasing in warmth and started to ""pinch"". Eventually this turned into pain, a searing hot, pinching pain in a very specific location. It got to the point where this pain was present all the time and really started to get in the way of my day to day life. I continued the forward fold because it felt like it brought relieve. 

I had a fundamental misunderstanding of how the spine worked. Eventually I went to Dr. Google and after tons of research and videos, the original commenter basically hit the nail on the head. I was able to do an at home adjustment by, essentially, bending backward over the arm of my sofa. (Dangerous can cause injury, please be careful if you do this.) Omg the sweet relief I got from that intense back bend. It was immediate and overwhelming. And all of my back pain went away immediately. 

The only difference is now, my back mobility (not so much twisting just bending forward and backward) is pretty tight. And I am also afraid of pushing it. I feel the twinge when I bend over to pick something off the ground. All bending is now supported with bent knees.

yoga,Help with elbow pain,"Hi all! A year ago, I did Yoga with Adrienne’s 30 day challenge and loved it, but I ended up hurting my elbow (or more likely making it worse?) while doing it.  I  now have full-blown golf elbow in my right arm and it isn’t going away. I stopped doing yoga, but it was something I really enjoyed, and so now that she is starting another month, I would love to get back into it.  I am worried at my elbow, though. 

Going to a live class for help and tips isn’t an option in the far rural place I live - so I wanted to ask the hive mind for some help. I have read about making sure to distribute my weight but I just don’t think I get it, and I am really worried about making it worse. I know for a fact my downward dog can’t be right.

yoga,Downward Dog is NOT a Beginner Pose,"I would really love to get into Yoga and practice it regularly, but every beginner video is always the same. It starts with a few simple poses that I find difficult but power through, and then about ten minutes in they break into Downward Dog and every pose from then on is a variation of Downward Dog. For the life of me I do not know how they expect a beginner to be able to jump into that pose on their first day. I do not have the flexibility in my back to make that pose, I do not have the strength or flexibility in my shoulders to do that pose, and I absolutely do not have the flexibility in my calves and hamstrings to do that pose. I can't do it at all. I'm just planking with my butt slightly in the air, and I can only hold it for 20 seconds. I don't think I've ever seen a beginner even come close to doing anything like it.

So, two things:

1) If you're an instructor, take Downward Dog out of your beginner classes, don't make it the foundational pose for every other pose, and slowly work up to it.
2) What are some modifications I can do for when invariably the class starts doing Downward Dog which nobody in the class can do except the instructor?

yoga,Venting because I’m frustrated with my progress,"Hey guys. I guess I just need to vent.

I’m in the process of losing weight. I started regularly doing yoga in early 2020 for primarily for mental health reasons. (Yoga is physical exercise too ofc, but I do other types of exercise for weight loss purposes.

I can’t say that I haven’t made any progress at all because I definitely have. I’m a little more flexible and I’m a little bit stronger after a year and 8 months of regular practice. And I’ve lost 30 pounds since then. I’m still overweight and need to lose 50-60 more pounds, but I’m just really frustrated that I still struggle to do more challenging yoga flows.

I just finished a vinyasa flow and though I feel good afterwards, I can’t help but feel frustrated that I still find simple things such as a chaturanga or 3-legged dog to be difficult. I feel so heavy and weak because of my weight, and sometimes it’s difficult to do poses correctly (or at all) because of my belly. I really struggled a lot during my practice today because there was so much I couldn’t do. I just feel so discouraged that this is still where I’m at when I’m coming up on 2 years of regular practice.

I know it takes time, but I feel like I would’ve progressed much faster if I wasn’t fat. I’m already working on my health, so there’s really nothing else I can do but be patient with myself and trust the process. But I just wanted to vent for a bit.

When I got back home, I started feeling slightly feverish. I had no other symptoms. In 4 days, I developed cough, loss of taste &amp; smell, chest pain and a lot of discomfort. I was sure I had COVID because I had most of the symptoms. My mom then started developing symptoms, and then we got tested positive for Covid-19. 
I was so blank. I was seeing death news everywhere and was praying for my mom's health. She was okay, but my health started getting bad. I had painful cough and breathing issues.

Simha Kriya is a breathing technique that takes about a couple of minutes only. I had energy for just that and for the rest of the time I would go back to sleep.

I’m sure many are familiar with the instruction to let ‘elbow creases shine forward’ in downward-facing dog. I’m gradually finding the position more accessible but wondered how I should interpret the elbow crease cue. In tabletop my elbow creases do face forward if I rotate my shoulders correctly, but in downward-facing dog the best I can get is elbow creases pointing towards each other left and right, even if I focus on rotating my shoulders. It’s not uncomfortable but I wonder if there’s something I should be doing differently? If the pose is done correctly do elbow creases literally point forward to the front edge of the mat?

yoga,Down Dog app,"I used to take an “Ashtanga-ish” class in a studio and loved it. The studio has been closed for many years, and I’ve never found an instructor that I like as much. The class was essentially a led primary series, but all levels and with new things occasionally mixed in. Usually, the sun salutations were reduced (5 and 5 for the sake of time), different poses were swapped in and out each week, and if you were able to do some things from a more advanced series, the strict Ashtanga rules were overlooked. Some bodies will never get certain poses, and my instructor didn’t think that should limit someone from working on others.
I’ve been looking into the Down Dog app, and it says it’s customizable, but I can’t tell *how* customizable it is. If I get it and load an Ashtanga class, can I reduce the number of sun salutations? Remove certain poses? Do the standing series and skip the seated, or vice versa? Or would I only be able to select the style and length of the class? Any info would be appreciated.

yoga,Yay! My first (mild) injury as a yoga novice.,"I was introduced to yoga about 4 months ago by some of my music buds in Nashville. I started tagging along with them before sessions and loved it.

Then, about 3 months ago, I got dumped by my GF of 8 years. Losing my house that I helped pay for and in general have just been in a very dark place.

When it happened, I immediate got on a plane to head home to fix things and literally bought a yoga pass to a local studio and have done it about 6 days a week ever since. My health was the only thing I had control over - and yoga has offered me a few hours of mental reprieve nearly every day.

Anyhow, I was at the yoga studio after a session and was like fuck it; I’m gonna do a double today (my ex and I still live together and I was avoiding going home). Turns out the slow flow was actually pretty tough and I pushed myself too hard. Properly effed something up in my shoulder.

I’m realizing I’ve literally become a yoga addict. Not being able to do it the last few days has me feeling like junk - and it’s made me realize just how completely helpful this has been to my recovery.

So to all the novices out there who are super obsessed like me… take it easy and listen to your body. Don’t try to impress or prove to anyone (including yourself) that you have to do something. 

If your legs and arms are numb in a hot26, walk out for a few mins. If you feel like your body is getting pushed beyond what it’s capable - or you’re experiencing sharp pain, stop! The other yoga folks in the room, many of them have years or experience. Don’t try to do what they’re doing!

Lastly, just want to say how grateful I am to have been introduced to yoga. This breakup has been absolutely hell (and I got a ways to go), but when I’m practicing, I kinda feel like the suffering is worth it, because I found something that is bringing me joy in a healthy way.

yoga,Suffering is Self Manufactured,"All your suffering is self manufactured. 

Realize that this moment now is a culmination of all the moments in your life, it is your doing; it is your choice to suffer by your own conditioned existence. 

Your memory of material engagements leads you to crave, fear and build up expectations. Most of all by creating our own condition of living on autopilot, constantly with our mind engaged in these temporary, illusory things. 

Through these cravings, fears, attachments and anxieties, we become bound from true living; we become blinded from true reality. 

The past and the future have not an ounce of weight nor reality. You’re never there nor then, always here and now. Here and now being the only thing we can influence. 

This moment is the most important thing. Whatever you do, right now in this moment, makes your future and alters your conditioning. It is the culmination of your past action.

Though we live in this moment, our mind is constantly adrift into the future (cravings, anxiety) and the past (remorse, attachments). Surely is it that this is how we unconsciously manifest our own hell.

The level of presence in this moment is directly related to your level of experience, freeedom, bliss, love, and release from suffering. Cultivate your presence and become free and living with vibrancy. This is yoga.

yoga,"Currently Running and Strength Training, Should I add Yoga to Reach My Goals?","tl;dr: My current schedule is to run everyday and add a strength workout on Mon, Wed, Fri. Would adding a 45-60min yoga session on Tues, Thurs, and Sat help me reach my goals in increased flexibility, body correction, and blood circulation? 


I was very active when I was younger. Since then, I've settled down quite a bit and had become more sedentary. I've always been an avid runner and still continue to run 4-6 miles a day. Somewhat recently, I started to incorporate some strength training and noticed my flexibility ain't what it used to be. I also developed a terrible Dowager hump due to being a software engineer, lose of muscle, and difficulty maintaining a good posture.


I am hoping adding Yoga on days that I don't strength training to help my flexibility, help correct my Dowager hump, and increase blood flow in my body. I recently downloaded Down Dog's Yoga app and tried my first 45 session. It was a lot of fun!


On to the actual questions -- is it worth it? Would doing three 45-60min sessions a week give me results over time? Or should I add shorter sessions everyday?

I like what I see.  I see an opportunity to increase some mobility, reduce aches and pains and get a more restorative workout; but I still want a workout.  

My question is a common one, which form to pick?  I would be doing this on my own, not in a yoga studio.  There aren’t any near me so an app would be best.  I downloaded down dog and it seems fine for a more gentle approach from what I can tell but is there a form that does it all?  Strength, flexibility, cardiovascular health and yet doable for a beginner?

yoga,Help with a reasonable schedule for Power Yoga,"Hello, this is my first post here. I hope this is the right place to ask.

I am writing because here we went into full lockdown again. Meaning, no studio until mid January, if lucky. I already do some yoga here and there at home, trying to stick to the x2/week I did in the studio.

But I want to start 2022 strong. I want to be stronger. Which I am seeing happening already this year with those yoga sessions + workouts. In 2022 I want to dedicate to yoga and see how far it gets me, using my own strength and build balance and flexibility. Also, because we are trying for a second baby, yoga is easier to maintain when pregnant. Until then, I want to focus on Power Yoga, which I love the most alongside Yin/Yang. But, with no studio, I do not want to over do it, and I'm afraid I will get injured along the way *(already restrained my old strained finger and will like to prevent that happening again).* 

Please help 🙏🏻 **Anyone has a nice 7-day schedule focusing on Power Yoga mixed with restorative yoga on rest days? Nothing specific, more like, how should I mix it? Is 4 days in a row of Power Yoga an hour doable?** Those are the 4 days I can focus without my toddler around. The other 3 days would be restorative (Yin, Hatha or Nidra). Or Should I mix them? How long is too long? Those kind of things.

Just a little bit weather change and I would wear my jacket and cap. The immunity so low that I could get a high fever after washing my hair and dared to enjoy standing in the wind.

If I'm awake till late the next day I would be so cranky and upset without a reason. I think I would have developed some kind of fear being weaker as a teenager. I could not enjoy so many things just because I would be sick or fell asleep early.

I was always fighting within that half of my life being wasted in eating, sleeping etc. when would I do all the things that I really wanted to do.

I do not smoke or drink alcohol but sleep really seem like my addiction and it really affected my relationship with family people and close friends.
Worse was to be anxious for going to a night time gathering as I would be so worried what if I cannot wake up on time to go to office.
May be because I can only be alert and creative in the early morning hours. I'm an artist and usually morning time work best for me.

And there is always that light at the end of tunnel. That's how Yoga entered my life and hugged me.
My life has tremendously improved since a few years because of yoga, plant based natural diet and doing some volunteering work.
Initially it was a very difficult transition. But slowly I became aware of things I could handle all by myself without depending upon anyone else.
It improved inter personal relationships. My fear and anxiety reduced drastically, crankyness vanished. I wasn't groggy after a nap. I was coping well after travelling to different city. I could start off quickly from where I had left my work. I could finally enjoy anything with full energy and not fall dead.
The sleep and restfulness of body calmed me down. Now I take 8 hours sleep only if wasn't feeling well.

Overall sleep hours reduced drastically to half.

yoga,Bakasana tips,"Hey guys! I'm doing yoga teacher training and now I'm trying to do the bakasana. My teacher says I'm ready to do it, but its hard for me to find the equilibrium point. I try to locate the strenght in the stomach, but its hard for me to stay still and can't last more than one second. I feel I don't know where or how to locate the legs

So I have two questions for you:

1. What are your general recommendations in the alineation of this asana?
2. Before doing it, I work in my manpura chakra and stretching my core (doing sun salutations or/with vasisthasanas and it helps me to feel renewed when trying it). Do you recommend any asanas to do before the bakasana?

Thank you all. 

Namaste 🤍

yoga,I think my yoga instructor molested me,"I’m writing this on a throwaway account but I want to know if I’m over reacting. So I’m a guy and I’ve been doing yoga for about 5 months and when in class the instructor gives hands on assistance if a student needs it. I never ask for it but we have a rule that if you have a marble on your mat it means your ok with it (which I’m cool with it). Anyway one of the teachers takes it to too far with me and I want other opinions because I’m not sure if I’m over reacting. 

A few times she’s placed her hands on my inner upper thigh really close to my privates, during chair pose she one time literally hugged me from behind and had her chest presses against my back. She’ll put her hands on my pecks and biceps and I really don’t like that. Once she was helping me with the happy baby pose and was staring directly at my private parts. And last night while doing savasana I had a towel over my eyes and she came up behind me and hand her face extremely close to mine and I swear I thought she was going to kiss me. It was really uncomfortable. I think she’s taking it to far and no other teacher at the studio does this and it’s bothering me. 

I know that there’s a stigma or misconceptions that this sort of thing doesn’t bother guys but I’m not comfortable with this and it really bothers me.

yoga,How do you get on your mat during periods of frustration and/ or emotional distress?,"Yoga has done wonders for my mental health and has helped me work through past trauma. 

I've recently received bad news about my dogs health. My spouse and I do not have children; our pets are children to us; they are family (no offense to anyone). I'm completely devastated. 

I feel lost. I've found myself shriveled in a ball instead of standing tall. The awareness I've cultivated over the past year and a half of a daily yoga practice, I fear, is slipping away. 

When I attempt to get on the mat, I just can't. I don't want the silence; I don't want to give my mind and body the space.  Each time I push through, I'm pushing my body further than I should. In a way, it's as if I'm becoming self-destructive. Fueling emotional pain with some form of physical pain.

yoga,Yoga that changed my life!,"Since the mid of 2020, I had developed so much lethargy and my health was going bad. I got critically low vitamin D and B12 and had to be taken to the hospital when my lips turned pale one day. It was a point where every news channel showed COVID death count around the world. I was a mess, mentally and physically. But in October, 2020,  a friend shared a video of Sadhguru with me where he spoke about how Inner Engineering can change people's experiences of life. I didn't really understand, but I enrolled myself for the program, but it was the first time he offered it online. I was confused but I went for it. On the initiation day, I felt something so beautiful. It was not happiness or sadness, but some sort of a 'high' for a while. Something so powerful. I started practicing whatever was taught everyday. And now, after one year of practice, my perception of things has changed. My temper has totally gone down (I was once an OCD struck angry little girl). I enjoy little things and so many opportunities have come my way to help the world and myself. 
My mother told me a couple of days ago that I have become a beautiful human. While I am not sure of that, I have definitely become a better one. Also, I did a few Hatha Yoga practices after that and my menstrual health and mental health have improved and I am now in a better place.

yoga,How to Dispose of Yoga Mats,"The vast majority of yoga mats are either made out of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), or thermoplastic elastomer (TPE). While these materials are theoretically recyclable, most yoga mats are manufactured with dyes and flame retardants that make them difficult for recycling plants to process. The sweat from your yoga sessions can also contaminate other recyclables it comes in contact with. Since yoga mats are so durable, the best way to get rid of one is to donate it to a group in need or reuse it instead of throwing it in the trash.

## Donating Your Mat

**1. Clean your mat thoroughly before recycling, donating, or reusing it.** Set your [yoga mat](https://fitbeastclub.com/collections/yoga/products/all-purpose-exercise-yoga-mat-fitbeast) out in a large sink or bathtub. Squirt 1–2 tablespoons (15–30 mL) of dish soap directly on to the mat. Grab a sponge or cloth and turn the cold water on. Scrub every section of your mat thoroughly with soap and water before flipping it over and cleaning the other side. Rinse all of the soap off before letting the mat air dry.

* You must clean the mat regardless of whether you’re donating, recycling, or reusing it.
* Some yoga mats are machine-washable. Look your yoga mat’s brand up online before machine-washing the mat.

2. **Contact a local homeless shelter to see if they can use the mat.** Look online to find contact information for homeless shelters in your area. Call each shelter to see if they could use your yoga mat. Homeless shelters often struggle to get funding and they can easily become overcrowded. Most shelters will use yoga mats and other plush materials to make makeshift bedding in the event that a lot of people show up and they run out of regular beds.

**Variation:** You may also be able to donate the mat to substance abuse clinics, orphanages, and other groups that service high-need communities. If the homeless shelters in your area aren’t taking yoga mats, don’t give up on trying to get it to someone in need

**3. Send your mats to a nonprofit organization that uses yoga to help people.** Look online to see if there is a nonprofit in your area that could use your yoga mat. You’d be surprised by how many volunteer groups there are that teach yoga to prison inmates, children, and trauma survivors. Since yoga encourages peace and positivity, many nonprofits use it as a vehicle to help people heal and grow.

* There are a few big nonprofits that you can ship your yoga mat to. Yoga Activist works with social programs and government agencies to help at-risk communities learn yoga. Off the Mat Into the World uses yoga outreach programs to promote social justice and equality.

4. **Reach out to a pet shelter if you want to help animals in need.** Like homeless shelters, many animal shelters are overcrowded and underfunded. Contact shelters in your area to see if you can drop the mat off. Animal shelters use the yoga mats as bedding for cats, dogs, and other pets. They also use them to transport smaller injured animals as well.

* Larger shelters that have decent funding, like the Humane Society, do not tend to accept yoga mat donations. Most local shelters will, though.

5. **Ask your local government if they have a donation program for yoga mats.** Call or email your government’s recycling or waste management department. Ask them if they have a donation program for yoga mats. Some large cities reuse yoga mats at public schools or in public work’s projects. If your city has one of these programs, follow their instructions to drop the mat off at a donation center.

* If you can’t find anywhere to donate your mat, ask the recycling and waste management department if you they can recycle it. The odds are high they won’t, but you’re already on the phone with them, so you might as well ask. Even if you don’t ultimately decide to recycle it, you’ll at least have a good starting point for your search.

## Upcycling Your Mat

1. **Cut your yoga mat up to create non-slip furniture pads.** Instead of paying for those small felt pads that go under chairs, sofas, and table legs, cut pieces of your yoga mat out to match the legs of your furniture. Yoga mats won’t scratch hardwood and they grip most floor quite well, which makes them ideal as furniture pads.

* You can cut a yoga mat with a pizza cutter, rotary cutter, razor blade, or utility knife.
* Be sure to clean your mat before upcycling or reusing it.

**Tip:** Yoga mats are designed not to slide around when they’re on hard surfaces. This makes yoga mats arguably better at padding furniture than actual furniture pads, which are prone to shifting around over time.  
2. **Set the mat in your trunk to keep items from sliding around.** Empty out your vehicle’s trunk. Set all of your belongings aside and clean the base of your trunk to remove any dirt. Then, set your yoga mat out flat in your trunk before putting all of your belongings back. The yoga mat will keep items from sliding around whenever you drive.

* Yoga mats are also designed to withstand high temperatures, since there are several forms of yoga that take place in hot environments. You may experience some wear and tear over time, but the yoga mat should generally hold up just fine in the summer.

3. **Bring the mat when you go camping to put under your sleeping bag.** Yoga mats are pliable and soft. They’re also easy to roll up and transport. This makes them ideal for camping. Take your mat with you the next time you’re spending a night outdoors. Instead of putting your sleeping bag directly on the ground, lay your yoga mat out first and put your sleeping bag on top of that. You’ll have a much easier time falling asleep on the soft surface!

* This is a great option if you have back or neck pain when you sleep on harder surfaces.

**4. Use the mat in your mudroom or entryway to protect your floor.** A yoga mat also makes a great platform for muddy or dirty shoes. Yoga mats are designed to be water-resistant since the people that use them for yoga end up getting quite sweaty. This means that they’re perfect for protecting your floor when you come inside with wet or dirty shoes.

* You can also set the mat down in front of your oven or sink to keep food scraps and water off of your kitchen floor.

5. **Trim the mat to use it as a placemat for your pet’s food and water bowl.** Cut your mat into a small rectangle using a razor blade, utility knife, or pizza cutter. Set your pet’s food and water bowl on top of it. Since the mat keeps items from sliding around, this is a great way to keep your excited dog from knocking a food bowl all over the place or that skittish cat from knocking over its water bowl.

* You can also put a litter box on top of the mat that you cut to keep your kitty from kicking litter all over the floor.

## Recycling Your Mat

**1. Contact recycling facilities in your area to see if they take yoga mats.** While yoga mats are typically pretty hard to recycle, some recycling facilities will accept your mat to be used as a cushion or recycling pad, kind of the way that they use rubber tires and acrylic sheeting. Some recycling facilities will actually recycle it by cutting it up and melting it into a new material. Call recycling facilities near you to find a center that will accept the mat.

* Some recycling centers for hazardous materials may take your yoga mat as well. Even if there isn’t anything hazardous about it to begin with, these facilities often recycle materials that require individual attention.
* Clean your yoga mat thoroughly before recycling it.

2. **Take your mat to the recycling facility and pay a small fee to recycle it.** Clean your mat thoroughly with soap and water. Let it air dry. Then, roll your yoga mat up and take it to the recycling facility. Most recycling facilities will charge a $1-10 fee for the yoga mat, so be prepared to pay the clerk behind the front desk before dropping your mat off.

* Bring other recyclables with you if you have any. It’s kind of a waste to show up with only one item!

3. **Get future mats from a company with a recycling program.** If you were getting rid of your mat because it was really worn down, buy your new mat from a company with a recycling program. Some yoga mat manufacturers will recycle your old mat so long as you buy your new mat from them. Unfortunately, none of these companies accept open donations, so this is really only an option if you’re buying a new mat.

* Two of the most popular companies with these recycling programs are LovEarth and Manduka.
* You will need to ship your mat to the company, but they will send you a prepaid label when you buy your new mat. All you have to do is take the old mat to a shipping facility with your label to send it back.

**Tip:** If possible, get a biodegradable mat! This way you won’t need to worry about recycling or donating your new mat in the future.",True,0,1639731689,2021-12-17

yoga,How to Use a Foam Roller on Your Legs," 

If you’re feeling sore from working out, using a foam roller on your legs can help massage them and loosen up your muscles. Foam rolling, or self-myofascial release, is the process of self-massaging tight muscles and can aid in muscle recovery. In order for foam rolling to be effective, you must make sure that you are targeting certain muscles in your legs. If you follow the proper techniques, you can use a [foam roller](https://fitbeastclub.com/collections/yoga/products/fitness-foam-rollers-fitbeast) on your quadriceps, calves, hamstrings, and outer thighs.

Using a Foam Roller on Your Quadriceps

**1.Lie with the foam roller under your thighs.** Put the foam roller under your body and lie face down, using your forearms to support your body. Elevate your body so that your back is straight and lift your toes off the floor. You should now be face down with your forearms on the floor and the foam roller should be 2-3 inches (5.08-7.62 cm) above your knees.

2. **Push backwards to roll towards your hip muscles.** Use your arms to move backward over the roller on the floor. The foam roller should roll up, towards your waist. Stop when the foam roller reaches the top of your thigh.

3. **Pull yourself forward to roll towards your knee.** Pull with your arms so that you roll forward and stop 2 inches (5.08 cm) above your knee. Do not roll the foam roller over your knee or it may be painful and could cause an injury.

4. **Roll back and forth for 30 seconds.** Continue rolling from two inches (5.08 cm) above your knee to the top of your thigh and back, in one fluid motion. Concentrate on knots, or tight areas in your thighs and spend a little more time pressing the roller against those areas.

Utilizing a Foam Roller on Your Calves

**1. Sit on the floor with your left leg extended over the foam roller.** Extend your left leg over the roller, with your toes pointing up. As you extend your leg over the roller, your right leg should be bent, with your foot on the floor. Support your posture by putting your hands down on the floor behind you.

* Sit down on a yoga mat or a carpeted floor.

**2. Position your left leg so the roller is two inches (5.08 cm) above your Achilles tendon.** Your Achilles tendon is the tissue that connects your calf to the heel on your foot. Scoot forward or backward so that the roller is positioned in the correct spot.

3. **Place your right leg over your left leg.** Cross your right leg over your left leg to create more weight on it. This will allow the foam roller to massage your calves deeply. Your ankles should be against each other and your left foot should still be pointed towards the ceiling.

**4. Slowly roll forward and backward.** Roll forward so that the foam rolls up your calf and stops just before the back of your knee. Then, use your hands to move backward so that the foam rolls back to the starting position, right above your heel. Continue repeating this motion back and forth for 30 seconds.

* Put your weight on your left leg so that the roller massages your calf.

5. **Flex your ankle.** Go back to the starting position, with your left leg over the roller, and flex your ankle back and forth over the foam roller. Your toes should be going forward and backward and you should feel stretching in your Achilles tendon. This is a separate exercise that will stretch your ankle and Achilles tendon.

6. **Repeat the process on your right leg.** Repeating the process with your other leg will ensure that you are massaging both legs equally. Do both exercises on each leg to complete the exercise.

Foam Rolling Your Hamstrings

**1. Sit on the floor with the foam roller just above your knees.** Sit down on a carpeted floor or yoga mat with the foam roller behind both of your knees. Plant your hands behind you so that you can keep your back straight. Elevate your legs so that they aren’t touching the ground and point your toes towards the ceiling.

* Avoid rolling behind the knee, which can damage sensitive tissues.

2. **Roll forward towards your buttocks.** Slowly push off your hands and roll forward so that the foam roller rolls back towards your buttocks. You should feel it massaging the back of your thighs.

3. **Roll back towards the back of your knee.** Use your hands and lean back so that the foam roller rolls back and stops 2 inches (5.08 cm) above the back of your knee.

4. **Continue rolling to stretch sore spots in your hamstrings.** Continue rolling up and down in a fluid motion for 30 seconds, or 10 repetitions.

Foam Rolling Your Outer Thighs

**1. Lie on your right side and position the roller under your hip.** The roller should be under you and pressing up against the outside of your thigh. Plant your palms onto the mat under you to support your body.

* Some physiotherapists recommend against rolling the outer thigh, as it can irritate the iliotibial band, which provides support to the knee. Consult your doctor and listen to your body to decide if this exercise makes sense for you. Stop using the roller if you feel pain or discomfort.

**2. Bend your left leg over your right leg and plant your foot on the ground.** Planting your left foot on the ground will help stabilize you as you do the exercise.

3.**Roll back and forth from your thigh to your hip.** Use your hands to push yourself so that the foam roller runs two inches (5.08 cm) above your knee. You do not want the roller to roll over the joint in this position or it could hurt you.

**4. Repeat the process on your left side.** Flip over to your left side and repeat the exercise to loosen up your left thigh. Once you roll on both for approximately 30 seconds on each leg, you’ll be done rolling your outer thighs.",True,0,1639727548,2021-12-17 15:52:28,,,ZacharyDC2022,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/riceb4/how_to_use_a_foam_roller_on_your_legs/,1,1.0,use foam roller leg feel sore work use foam roller leg help massage loosen muscle foam roll selfmyofascial release process selfmassaging tight muscle aid muscle recovery order foam roll effective must make sure target certain muscle leg follow proper technique use quadriceps calve hamstring outer thigh use foam roller quadriceps 1lie foam roller thigh put foam roller body lie face use forearm support body elevate body back straight lift toe floor face forearm floor foam roller 23 inch 508762 cm knee 2 push backwards roll towards hip muscle use arm move backward roller floor foam roller roll towards waist stop foam roller reach top thigh 3 pull forward roll towards knee pull arm roll forward stop 2 inch 508 cm knee roll foam roller knee may painful cause injury 4 roll back forth 30 second continue roll two inch 508 cm knee top thigh back one fluid motion concentrate knot tight area thigh spend little time press roller area utilize foam roller calve 1 sit floor leave leg extend foam roller extend leave leg roller toe point extend leg roller right leg bend foot floor support posture put hand floor behind sit mat carpet floor 2 position leave leg roller two inch 508 cm achilles tendon achilles tendon tissue connect calf heel foot scoot forward backward roller position correct spot 3 place right leg leave leg cross right leg leave leg create weight allow foam roller massage calve deeply ankle leave foot still point towards ceiling 4 slowly roll forward backward roll forward foam roll calf stop back knee use hand move backward foam roll back start position right heel continue repeat motion back forth 30 second put weight leave leg roller massage calf 5 flex ankle go back start position leave leg roller flex ankle back forth foam roller toe go forward backward feel stretch achilles tendon separate exercise stretch ankle achilles tendon 6 repeat process right leg repeat process leg ensure massage leg equally exercise leg complete exercise foam roll hamstring 1 sit floor foam roller knee sit carpet floor mat foam roller behind knee plant hand behind keep back straight elevate leg arent touch grind point toe towards ceiling avoid roll behind knee damage sensitive tissue 2 roll forward towards buttock slowly push hand roll forward foam roller roll back towards buttock feel massage back thigh 3 roll back towards back knee use hand lean back foam roller roll back stop 2 inch 508 cm back knee 4 continue roll stretch sore spot hamstring continue roll fluid motion 30 second 10 repetition foam roll outer thigh 1 lie right side position roller hip roller press outside thigh plant palm onto mat support body physiotherapist recommend roll outer thigh irritate iliotibial band provide support knee consult doctor listen body decide exercise make sense stop use roller feel pain discomfort 2 bend leave leg right leg plant foot grind plant leave foot grind help stabilize exercise 3roll back forth thigh hip use hand push foam roller run two inch 508 cm knee want roller roll joint position hurt 4 repeat process leave side flip leave side repeat exercise loosen leave thigh roll approximately 30 second leg youll roll outer thigh,454,133,0,7,0
yoga,Newfound passion in yoga,"Hi, I've lurked here a few months and I figured I'd finally say something after the month I've had.

I struggle with my mental health and a couple of weeks ago, I had to be admitted to a behavioral hospital. For recreational therapy, I was encouraged to attend one of their yoga classes. I've been doing yoga here and there for years by way of DVD or youtube. This was different somehow. My mind was clear after and it made me feel energized for the rest of the day- despite how mind-numbingly boring a hospital can be. 

When I was released, I thought on it and got a gym membership with classes included. Then I attended my first hatha yoga class. I was blown away. It was hard but still relaxing. It made me feel capable and strong. I was able to receive correction on poses. I'm hooked. I had no idea that attending a live class would make such a difference for me.

yoga,Feeling overwhelmed and frustrated as hyper-inflexible man.,"tldr : Beginner yoga is miles away from my reality, can't find yoga lessons designed for me, need advice on learning how to create my own yoga.

Hello everybody ! 

I'm very frustrated and lost.

my flexibility is terrible. and before you say ""ha, another complaining beginner who can't do some research by himself"" hear me out.

I hate being put in the large ""beginner , inflexible group"" cause that group does not represent me.

 When I was a kid I did a flexibility test and score much much lower than the minimum imagined by the test. no kids ever scores lower than 1 point in my teacher career and i score something like -20 points ! based on that experience, i can assume i am in the 1% least flexible population or even worst. 

as a 26 years old fit man, this is crippling my life as I cannot work anymore on what I love due to back problems related to inflexibility and labor.

Beginner yoga is miles away from my reality. I can imagine that in 20 years of regular practice I will acheive some of the yoga poses shown in videos titles "" yoga for inflexible beginners"" 
in 20 years ! 

i need to practice yoga daily for my sake, but I need to find a course, teacher, book or whatever that is designed for people who will probably start touching there toes after 10 years of practice. 

I've already did reasearch and here come my frustration. I cannot find anything designed for me. 
i think I have to learn more about the foundamentals and create my own version based on what I learned.

so if you know yoga that could represent a young fit man with crippling inflexibility and back problems that would be magical, 
but if not , I'm looking for guidance for making my own journey and having the knowledge to adjust and personalize yoga to my own needs and limitations.

I never needed a lot of ""stuff"" and there was even a time while living in Myanmar that I thought I was going to become a full-on minimalist aka Buddhist nun... but I ended up in India dancing in Bollywood for a year instead lol.  
Anyway, after teaching in 9 countries I've come back to the states and now I've begun a Patreon that I'd really appreciate if you'd look at.  
I am in a space where I have a ton of content in yoga topics and would like to share it. I also am in a place where I have to live in the economy-not a nun- and appreciate any donations.. All of my classes give a percentage to organizations I've learned to love around the world.  
There are options for full classes for only $8.

yoga,I think I accidentally got a yoga teacher fired.,"(I'm a guy, if that's relevant to the story. It might be, it might not, who knows)

I started going to a new studio recently, and on my first day there, I had an awkward interaction. After checking in, I was putting my things away in the locker, when the instructor comes out. She introduces herself, and I introduce myself. Just a normal interaction, nothing weird. A moment later, she re-asks my name, and I gave it. She then said ""That's Susan"" (not the actual name).

I thought I misheard her, and asked ""Your name's Susan?""

She pointed and said, ""No, that's Susan."" She pointed at another student who was a few feet away, whom I hadn't interacted with. I just awkwardly mumbled hello, then finished putting my things away and headed into the studio. I got ready for class and waited. Susan came in and got in the back.

Class started, and at some point I realized she wasn't in the room anymore, but I didn't give it any more mind, as I was focused on my own practice. At some point during class, we were in child's pose, and all of a sudden, the teacher's voice changed. Next time we got up, we had a different instructor. After class, the instructor told us the normal instructor wasn't feeling well and had to step out.

When I was looking at the class schedule later, I noticed that all of the instructor's classes were listed as ""cancelled"". Some time goes by, and I realized her name was no longer on the schedule, period.

It was definitely weird that someone I didn't even know tried to introduce me to another student I had had zero interaction with, but I didn't think it was worth making a complaint about. Is it possible she was so uncomfortable that she decided to say something to the staff? It's especially strange that they swapped out instructors mid-class.

Next year I will have to luxury of taking half the year off; and am planning on taking the time for myself and looking after my body - and wished to push my yoga practice.

I am looking for a retreat/school that is long term (1 or 2 months) &amp; that focuses on pushing oneself in the practice. 

Im looking for something you can find in the fitness/muai thai boxing worlds for example; camps where you train 2x per day + complementary activities (in these cases would be yoga/stretching/meditation to complement the 4 to 6H of workouts and practice per day.

In the yoga world; all I seem to find are 200H/300H teacher courses. 

This is NOT what I am looking for… the advice I have consistently received is that “it will be a great journey and you will learn so much” …but having reached out to many schools; the programs are simply not what I want (2H of practice per day + the rest is theory / knowledge / becoming a teacher). 

I aim for much more practice (4H/day minimum).

yoga,Advice on how to get back into yoga without aggravating shoulder impingement?,"Hi! I was finally getting into a regular practice, doing mostly power yoga. My experience prior had been hatha, but I don’t do much else for exercise so I wanted to get into something more intense. This sounds silly, but after I spent a few hours sorting/filing a huge stack of papers, I started to have shoulder pain. There’s also snow shoveling last winter that’s hard on the shoulders. And I suspect I might have done too much and/or had poor form doing yoga at the same time; it was heavy on down dog. I work at a computer and I’m sure my shoulders roll forward to an extent. I had X-rays and nothing was found. I was told to load up on anti-inflammatory over the counters and could try physical therapy (should have taken him up but didn’t).

yoga,Death Meditation,"Suppose I were to die tonight. In the flash of my life what would I see? What Business unfinished, what words unsaid?

Suppose I were to die today. What fears, regrets I hold onto; or rather that hold onto me? 

Did I live my life fully, immersed in its moment? 
Was I courageous and contented in all I was given? 

For what weight does yesterday have to us? And the future included? You’re never there or then, always here and now. 

Yet our eyes, hearts, and spirits enslave themselves to illusions temporal. 

Always seeking attainments, comforts, gratification. But what is the result of this effort? 

Only enforcement of cravings; and attachment to what was, and how it ‘should’ be. These visions delude us, binding and blinding. 

What is eternal but the present moment? Is this not where true living lies? The only misery is found in ignorance and rigidity. 

Bring your eye, mind, and spirit to where they come back to, be witness to this moment everlasting. 

Bring yourself back out your illusion, for these miseries did not cloud you in birth, but only after identity comes does this ignorance start to deepen. 

In this moment is found bliss, love, and life; true freedom, true peace. Equanimity in tragedy and cravings alike.

Surely it is, I may die today; so I’ll finish my business to free my regrets. I’ll experience this moment with presence, in its fullest. I’ll chase out the fears which hold me back. I’ll love all around me and shine with life vibrantly! 

So since I may face death tonight, my shoulders be light; so my eye will be focused, my heart will be full, and I will be open.",True,0,1639381866,2021-12-13 15:51:06,,,Solanum47,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/rfah22/death_meditation/,1,1.0,death suppose die tonight flash life see business unfinished word unsay suppose die today fear regret hold onto rather hold onto live life fully immerse moment courageous content give weight yesterday u future include never always yet eye heart spirit enslave illusion temporal always seek attainment comfort gratification result effort enforcement crave attachment vision delude u bind blind eternal present moment true live lie misery find ignorance rigidity bring eye mind spirit come back witness moment everlasting bring back illusion misery cloud birth identity come ignorance start deepen moment find bliss love life true freedom true peace equanimity tragedy crave alike surely may die today ill finish business free regret ill experience moment presence fullest ill chase fear hold back ill love around shine life vibrantly may face death tonight shoulder light eye focus heart full open,113,55,0,0,10

Becoming Truly Energetic and Alive:  


📽 The Miraculous Effects of Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgvj0wXHaPo  


Sadhguru: “Once you start certain spiritual practices, you might have seen that your level of energy is totally different. Your ability to stay awake, not be tired and to go on with life is so much better once you start these practices. If you practice these kriyas daily, you can see that if you don’t do them for one day, there is a distinct difference. In a way, all spiritual practices – the kriyas and meditation – are fundamentally to make your energies more awake than what they are right now. You will definitely notice that on a certain day, if you are very happy, you seem to be very energetic. Another day, when you are not so happy, you have no energy. One reason we are always talking about being peaceful and happy is not for the sake of peace and happiness, but only because if a person is peaceful and happy, his energies begin to come alive in a certain way. Otherwise, the system is simply blocked up. Only if these energies are alive can you activate them towards a higher possibility.”

yoga,manana practice of psychic messaging and spiritual isolation kaivalyam,"i am very nervous to share this post. i tried sharing in another type of community and got banned for advertising when i was really just looking for ppl to sort of validate my work or share my experience. basically by studying manana as dharana in ashtanga very intently, like with no other hobbies, i have developed a psychic relationship with someone i know and were working together to scientifically prove it on reddit. it is emotionally exhausting to justify my self in this way because its degrading but its relevant for the work i want to do and a revolutionary harm reduced future of access and care.

the intent of this post is just to have a conversation with anyone who has experienced kaivalyam and to share experience because i have been drugged and hospitalized numerous times for experiencing spiritual awakening and also learned to avoid captivity by articulating my self better but never had a community i could relate with using my personal perspective regarding.

also im wondering how i should go about getting students, like what communities besides yoga, because i want to be with my partner but he says i need to be more financially independent so i need clients. so far i have three programs and four levels of class. it starts with recognizing meaning in the movement of colors, which i have defined in an initiation with what my partner calls protophorms which are like metaphysical parts.

yoga,Sharp elbow pain lowering in chaturanga - could this be because of how I lower down?,"Hi, I've recently been experiencing a sharp pain in my left elbow when lowering into chaturanga.  I've been treating the motion like a pushup, stacking my wrists below elbows below shoulders in plank, and lowering straight down, so my wrists end up more below my shoulders than below my elbows. I found this article which says to lower 'forward' instead of straight down, so the elbows end up over the wrists instead of behind the wrists: [https://yogainternational.com/article/view/realign-chaturanga](https://yogainternational.com/article/view/realign-chaturanga)

I'm surprised that I hadn't come across this instruction before. I spoke with a yoga teacher about the elbow pain but they didn't comment on my chaturanga form -- I've been practicing yoga for years, and feel humbled to have missed this alignment instruction about such a fundamental pose. (Possibly relatedly, the pain started when I began practicing jumping back from forward fold into chaturanga - maybe exacerbating the harmful effects of the misalignment by jumping into it?)

I just wanted to share in case this can help anyone else, and in case anyone else has comments about chaturanga form &amp; elbow pain.

The first 6 minutes are just laying down and breathing. This was uncomfortable.

So… excuse my language, but what fuck was that reaction? I understand conceptually that breathing is supposed to be important but I just haven’t experienced any benefits at alllll from it.

yoga,Have trouble holding my legs straight up in certain positions,"I am pretty active and have done yoga on and off for a couple of years but only really consistently for about a month.

I struggle with this in a couple of different ways:

When I am lying on my back, and have to hold my legs raised straight above, and when I am standing and have to hold one leg straight in front of me. (Sorry I can't find the names of these poses) 

The other week, I was standing up with my left raised directly in front of me and a yoga teacher raised my leg with their hand until it was higher up, but when he removed his hand my leg just dropped again. :(

yoga,Keeping my back straight / hamstrings,"I decided three days ago to take up yoga, and so far for the past three days I've done 30 - 45 mins of Yin, holding poses for 10 - 15 breaths, or less if they're straining to me.

I've found that I'm relatively flexible in some ways (can do the malasana squat pretty fine, the dragon too, the saddle...) but reaaally not in others. For example, I'm totally unable to reach my toes when standing straight with my legs together. I can only just get my hands past my knees, and that definitely hurts, I wouldn't hold it that long. 
Also, if I'm sat on the ground and have to reach out to one or both outstretched legs in front of me, I can reach to my ankles but it hurts quite a bit, and my back is very curved. I would really like to work on my back straighteness when sat down with one or both legs outstretched, it's really difficult for me. I've been doing it by pressing my back against a wall to make sure it stays like that. I think it's my hamstrings, although I'm not certain. 

Any ideas how long it would take to develop that back straightness / hamstring flexibility if I were to do 30 mins of yoga everyday? I want to keep up yoga because it merges several practises I want to make habits, and I can feel that it's good for my body AND my mind. My logic in asking this question is that if I know what a realistic time scale would be for me develop some of that back straightness I may be able to be more patient and less hard on myself.

Any other advice is welcome too, I'm a total newbie !

yoga,Does anyone have any experience using pso-rite? Has it helped your practice at all?,"So I have always had tight hips and posture that’s not too great, but the past few years it’s been exasperated because I work a desk job (I’m an accountant) and have had a pretty stressful life. Not to be confused with a bad life by any means, I’m just prone to overthinking and especially went through some stuff in my early 20s while in uni so it was magnified by my propensity to stress. But I’ve always worked out and and stayed in pretty good shape and have been doing yoga for 5ish years (on and off during COVID though).

I saw a post a few days ago asking if anyone has ever cried during yoga. I’ll be honest, at first glance I was like come on…really? But after reading the comments I realized I misunderstood. I saw a BUNCH of comments about stress being held in the hips. It all made sense to me at that moment and that’s when I started looking into it. Turns out that hips mobility and pain is almost always caused by the psoas muscle. I’ve heard of the psoas muscle and the psoas originally from David Goggins on Joe Rogan a few years ago but sort of didn’t really pay attention to it. After a bunch of research I was convinced. My psoas is probably torqued beyond belief. I randomly get pain in my hip, my lower back ALWAYS hurts, sometimes I’m even tilted forward. So I looked at the price and laughed…looked into alternatives but couldn’t find any (guess the patent is tight). So I said ah I’ve spent $100(CAD) on dumber things and is there really a price if it actually works? So it’s on the way. 

So back to yoga, I’m decent at a lot of poses but there’s a lot I struggle with and almost all of them have to do with my hips and their lack of mobility, like I can do a handstand from crow pose…yet my three legged downward facing dog is a joke… I heard that the pso-rite could help but has anyone had any experience/luck with it? 

(And guys, please no “$100 for a piece of plastic?!” comments. It is what it is, let’s focus on the benefits and experience.)

yoga,"Last time, I couldn’t do a down dog. Now, down dog is my favourite resting pose!","I posted here before asking tips to do a down dog. I used to view yoga as something that only skinny flexible people can do. Like touch their toes. 

Everyone online looked like perfect inverted Vs when doing their down dog. First time I tried, I was a U who couldn’t hold their own body weight.

The people here taught me that yoga is very subjective and it’s ok to have variations in poses. Something that I never thought about. I’ve always thought that I have to be as perfect as those that made it their livelihood.

yoga,"Finally, I have reached the end of the beginning!","It's been slow but steady. I started doing a gentle morning yoga for beginners with Adriene (20 minutes). I did that almost every day then I switched to another 20 minute Adriene video about 3 weeks ago. This one has downward dog in it. Getting through that part was a struggle. And then it started to get a bit easier. And within the last week or 10 days, it was not enough.

The first 4 months my progress was linear. Slow but steady and with many positive benefits. But in the past week, I've made a huge jump. I'm now averaging over 40 minutes a day and I feel like a reached a level where I can go to a yoga studio and not be sucking wind after 20 minutes of a beginner class. I'm also exploring new teachers and videos. (Kassandra rocks, she makes me sweat)

And the difference a week has made in my posture. Now my posture has been getting better pretty steady, but this Sunday's drive to church was much different from last Sunday's.  I got into the car and assumed my normal driving position. My body said ""Nah, we're not going to sit that way."" Confused, I just kind of grunted ""Hrrrh?"" The body said ""We would prefer if you sat straight up, shoulders back, grounding down through the elbows, making some space between the shoulders and the ears. Think head over the heart, heart over the pelvis."" I said ""Seriously?"". And the body ""Yeah, we like this better and you probably should adjust your mirrors.""

As the title says, I get occasional nausea when I engage Ujjayi breathing, and I'm wondering if anyone else does or might be able to shed some light on why this happens? 

It's usually pretty 'light' nausea, ie, the nauseous sensation comes from the throat area rather than the stomach/a feeling of being ill. But earlier, during Bhastrika breathing (in a sitting twist position), I had to stop because I actually started wrenching. 

I used to be 'proned' to nausea/vomitting because of hormones and also during times of stress, but that's practically non existent these days -from stress at least - so I'm not sure it's related.

yoga,Did I go too far?,"Hi fellow yogis, 

I (25 F) am writing here to get your opinions on something. I apologize in advance for my average English! So back story, I have been practicing yoga very intensely (6-7 days a week, 75 mins each time) for the past 3 years. When I started, I could barely touch my toes. Now, I can do many advanced poses that require flexibility and balance, including the crow, headstand, scorpion, etc. For the past 5-6 months, I have been having quite an intense knee and elbow pain. I feel that my body has become SO flexible that I am overdoing every pose and my joints are not able to take it anymore. Another thing is that I have noticed that every time we do a pose that requires strength, I shake A LOT. Arms, legs, whatever pose that requires strength, my whole body starts shaking. Basically, I have become very flexible so I am able to do a lot of advanced poses, but I feel the lack of body strength is starting to be a problem. I went to see an orthopedist who hasn't diagnosed me fully cuz I need to do x-rays, but he thinks it might be patellar syndrome (basically overusing my knee and desintegrating the tissues around my knee). I want to know if this has ever happened to anyone ? A problem of being hyperflexible and lacking strength and developing injuries? If so, did you stop yoga? Did you switch to something different? I am thinking of trying pilates, as I know it works on both muscle and flexibility. Would love to have anyone's advice!

yoga,Why I think there will never be a yoga community without showing off difficult poses,"So, I had these thoughts surrounding achievements in yoga but also outside of it and I thought I'd share them here:

I was just thinking about why yogis online tend to show these ultra-difficult poses and transitions in here as COMP or also yoga teachers and influencers on Instagram etc. Which leads to a very distorted and intimidating view of yoga although yoga should be about your own journey and your own journey only, without comparison.

And I realized why that's the case (apart from them just looking cool and being fun to play around with).

I think there are two types of achievements and we tend to show only one of them to others. That is the visual achievement where I can say ""look what I can do"" (or also general for every achievement in life ""look what I did""). It's an easy way for us to show our achievement and success and get positive feedback for it because there is a factual component to it that people around us are able to grasp.

The other type of achievement is the inner achievement. Where we feel a difference in ourselves which is truly for us and for us only. They are often much more validating to us. In yoga they show as how we feel since we started our journey, how we feel during or after our practice but also how poses feel to us.

An example would be a more solid Warrior 2 where I can feel how the correct alignment unlocks so many benefits that make the pose so much more enjoyable, how I feel more confident with the pose over time, being able to hold it for longer without getting shaky, how I smile a little when the pose comes up because I want to be in the pose etc. But also outside of yoga sucu achievements can be how we grow happier with our job, have more balance in life, find the joy in little things etc.

But the downside to these sorts of achievements is that we can't simply say ""look how I feel"". It simply is harder for the people around us to undersaltand these achievements, they can only listen to what we describe and trust us. And likewise, for us these achievements come slower, they aren't that sort of ""I did this pose for the first time today"" so there's no initial joy in it, it only is through reflection that we notice for example ""I did this pose already 200 times and it never felt as good as it does now"". Which also leads to us keeping these achievements to ourselves and only notice them every now and then but there's no moment where we think ""look, look, I have to show you this!"".

Of course that doesn't mean that the latter achievements are worth less, they are just less ""shareable"" with others but also online and there's less impulse to share them because they don't evoke such clear and sudden feelings in us.

This basically made me realize how distorted the perception of achievements is, it really is like an iceberg. While we may have this achievement with that one pose we wanted to learn we have hundreds of other achievements in ouselves simultaneously that never come to the surface for others.

But I don't think it's a bad thing. While yoga shouldn't be intimdating and comparison has no place in this beautiful practice, it's good to keep all those inner achievements to ourselves and only share them every now and then if we want to.

yoga,Yin and Iyegar yoga- Soreness and questions,"So I went to my physio after having complaints of hip pain while sitting and cycling; cycle and run on the regular with out incorporating a cool down  


She pointed out the all my muscles in my lower body/back were extremely tight and I need to stretch them out. She gave me some stretches but after some lurking on this subreddit I figured iyegar and yin yoga seem to have helped people the most.  


I did Iyegar yoga one day and felt nice and loose, the next day I wanted to alternate and try Yin so I did, an hour of Yin felt great but woke up the next day everything feeling sore, I did a 20 mins stretch warmed up and went cycling but my glutes were really sore and I felt a 2/10 discomfort so I came home early. Just lying down relaxing I feel this soreness/pulling feeling in my glutes but it doesn't correspond with the symptoms of yoga butt. I foam roll it and it immediately goes away. Can anyone tell me if this is okay/normal? I still did some yin yoga today to stretch out my hips/hamstrings and glutes but I had the same feeling in my glutes a while after; not during. I foam rolled it out and it's fine now.

yoga,Predatory yoga instructors,"

{trigger warning: sexual assault}


Hi, this is a difficult post to write but if it helps just one person out there it’s all worth it.

Recently I saw on the news that my former yoga instructor had been charged in court with molesting 5 students in classes.

This triggered flashbacks. It started with those occasional brushes against sensitive areas in classes.  He was a respected, popular instructor.  I was just a beginner. I brushed them off as accidents or merely part of the adjustments. After all, this studio was known for providing extensive physical adjustments to its students. And these adjustments did in fact help me in my progress.

Then one day he told me he could help me work on poses I was weak at. I could drop by his place which was just a few stops from mine. Guess what? I accepted his offer. 

I turned up at his place. It started like a normal personal training session. Then the “accidental brushes” started. And then they became deliberate. I kept saying no and pushing him away. But he wouldn’t stop and eventually he pushed me onto his bed and assaulted me there. I felt my soul leave my body at that point.  I was filled with guilt, humiliation and self-loathing for a long time afterwards.

Girls and guys, all I want to say is to please please trust your instincts.  if a touch by your instructor makes you feel  uncomfortable, please don’t second guess yourself. Something is probably amiss. Your instincts are there to protect you. Anyway, under NO circumstances should an instructor touch your privates, or touch you with theirs, during adjustments.  And If they do so accidentally (and accidents do happen), they would apologize. This instructor never did apologize.

Yoga is supposed to be empowering, not degrading. I don’t wish for anyone to go through the same trauma.

yoga,"I'd love some wisdom if there's any to be had—I'm going on my first-ever yoga retreat this weekend, YAY!!! For anyone who's done a retreat before, what are the things you wished you knew beforehand?","This may be a dumb frivolous post, but I have no one IRL to ask and I'm craving some real, non-listicle, human advice!

I'm so excited and grateful to have this opportunity—it's a 3-day weekend retreat run by two of my favorite teachers from the studio where I've been doing trade shifts since early this summer, so 6 or 7 months. It's VERY expensive (my Christmas gift from my husband this year) and there will only be about a dozen people there total, so I want to make the absolute most of my time and feel the most comfortable I possibly can while I'm there. (Hellooooo, social anxiety!) Which, for me, means feeling fully prepared in all the ways I *can* be (ie mostly material things), so that I can be open to all the things I know I can't prepare for (the spiritual, emotional, etc).

This particular retreat includes:

- Daily yoga, meditation, and pranayama (morning and evening)

- Sacred New Moon ceremony

- ALL meals included

- Plant-based cooking class

So I feel like the weekend will probably be PRETTY packed, but I do want to feel out what's normal for the non-yoga activities.

yoga,Question about yoga in relation to better posture,"My posture isn’t brilliant, and to help combat that and some of the muscular imbalances I have, I’ve started doing yoga. 

If you slouch or have bad posture you obviously measure a bit shorter; If I measure my height and try and stand as tall as possible, I gain height compared to when I measure at my normal not so good posture. 

Is the height I measure at when I’m standing as tall as possible my maximum? Or is it possible that my maximum straightness isn’t at its full potential due to tight muscles and so on?

I know yoga cannot literally increase you height because that’s down to your skeletal size, but I routinely see people on here talk about gaining height due to corrected posture from doing yoga. I just wonder, considering I have a ton of muscle tightness, that even me trying to stand at my tallest and maintain what I *consider* perfect posture is not actually perfect at all.

yoga,Starting a year-long animation job and seeking advice on building a routine to counterbalance it,"Hey there,

I just started a new job as an animation director and it's very exciting on the one hand-- biggest career success I've ever had! -- and also pretty terrifying. Most of all, I'm worried about the physical effects of all the sitting and drawing. When I was in school I worked on an animated senior film for a year and a half, and ended up with some wrist and nerve problems that took a long time to heal.

I'm not very knowledgeable about yoga, but I know where I hurt! If anybody could help me build a morning yoga routine, I'd be very thankful. Here are the things I'm working with:

For one thing, there's a ton of sitting, and all the physical imbalances that causes. It's traditional 2D animation, so I'm going to be drawing the whole time, which leads to stiff shoulders, upper back and all kinds of tension through the forearm and hands. (When I get really engrossed in a drawing, I often start to hold the pen super tight.) I often notice pain in my shoulder blades-- the right one especially, connected to my drawing hand. My neck has also been CRAZY stiff and painful recently. There's also some tension in my right hip, maybe connected to the sitting. It's sort of in the ""corner"" of where my leg meets my torso, if that makes sense. 

In the past I've spent a lot of time working out with dumbbells, and although I'll probably still work out some, I don't want to rely on it in the way I have. In the past, alternating between weightlifting and sitting at a desk has just led to a lot of physical tension and stiffness-- I'd like to try an approach where I reduce the tension in my body rather than add to it.

Anyway, thanks to anyone who helps! I'd really appreciate some knowledge.",True,3,1638306825,2021-12-01 05:13:45,,,wrinkledlion,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/r5xln4/starting_a_yearlong_animation_job_and_seeking/,1,1.0,start yearlong animation job seek advice build routine counterbalance hey start new job animation director excite one hand biggest career success pretty terrify worry physical effect sit draw school work animate senior film year half end wrist nerve problem take long time heal knowledgeable know hurt anybody help build morning routine id thankful thing work one thing ton sit physical imbalance cause traditional 2d animation go draw whole time lead stiff shoulder upper back kind tension forearm hand really engross draw often start hold pen super tight often notice pain shoulder blade right one especially connect draw hand neck crazy stiff painful recently tension right hip maybe connect sit sort corner leg meet torso make sense past spend lot time work dumbbell although ill probably still work want rely way past alternate weightlift sit desk lead lot physical tension stiffness id try approach reduce tension body rather add anyway thank anyone help id really appreciate knowledge,138,63,0,0,13

yoga,Question - Feeling Sore/Tight,"So I've been practicing for about 3 years now, on and off. I would practice yoga on my off days from crossfit. I recently have had to take time off due to a forearm injury and have been focusing on yoga to fill the void.

I'd say for the past 2 months I been doing a hot yoga practice 3x a week and 2x slow/yin practice along with running. No lifting.  I'm a lot more in tune with my mind &amp; body now. I don't view yoga as a competition, like I use to. So I'm able to get into a deeper stretch and focus on muscle groups I didn't know I had during poses. I've recently realized how to use my abs instead of my overactive hip flexors! Haha.

I've noticed that I'm constantly sore/tight now. More so  than when I was doing crossfit &amp; heavy lifting 5x a week. For example my hamstrings, hips, and lats always seem to be things I'm constantly stretching during the day. Certain muscle groups feel more sluggish the next day after yoga than when I was lifting.

yoga,(Moderate exp.) Accumulated shoulder muscle tension and pain - how to work with?,"Been doing yoga for about 4-5 years now.

I tend to carry my stress and tension in my shoulder already but it seems doing a lot of the main poses (downward dog, upward dog, push ups even) puts more tension into my shoulder muscles which then creates more work for me to massage them etc. to feel better.

Is this a common experience? Am I doing the poses wrong (which I don’t think I am, but can’t rule out since I practice alone by and large)?

yoga,How can I communicate that my yoga teaching is focused on senior citizens?,"Hello friends! I started my own yoga business after the studio where I’d taught for years closed permanently due to the pandemic. I’m hoping for some advice on advertising to senior citizens.

My website is currently silent on the age of my students. However, what I’ve found as a teacher is the population of students who follow me and who most benefit from my teaching is senior citizens. When I began teaching, the studio owner told me each teacher would have a unique group of students who really love their teaching, and for me it unexpectedly became senior women doing yoga as cross-training for their other passions - hiking, skiing, gardening, etc. These students have taken my classes 3-4 times per week for 5 years, I have deeply studied how to teach them, and I’ve found the population I’m deeply passionate about teaching is seniors.

yoga,New yoga teacher tips and advice-,"Hi yogis,

So I passed my 200 hour in June in hatha/vinyasa after practicing for around 18 months. I am teaching online for free to a couple of friends and start with my first paying students next week! 
In regards to my personal practice I am still trying to find the best way to become an amazing teacher whilst still being a student.
There are no studios near me that have a timetable that suits me so I have started to attend some online classes. However, I’ve begun to find these too slow and I switch off and end up doing my own practice instead of theirs!
Since YTT I have probably been to 10 different teachers classes just to observe their styles etc and look for inspiration.
I think the best things for me to be doing for now are…

Plan my own classes which I will deliver and practice those instead of attending online classes until I find a studio that works for me.

Keep working on my own sadhana…(I am strong in all areas apart from hamstring/lower back flexibility right now which I am working on daily).

Make sure I am rotating through the different focus areas of the body hips, hamstrings, lower back et (for myself and for students).

Keep incorporating new elements of teaching to be included in my classes for example kriyas, pranayamas, uncommon poses and variations of ‘base poses’ to give my classes good variation.

Try to find a ‘master’ to practice with a few times a month.

Select maybe 3 set sequences for my classes of ‘common standing and balancing poses’ to be varied depending on focus of the class.

So I guess I’m wondering if there’s anywhere online that offers the knowledge/materials of or similar to a YTT in a relatively structured, course-like manner just without the teaching stuff. I don’t mind paying a bit of money.

yoga,Tips for Focus Less on Flexibility?,"Many posts here have mentioned the damage that some hyper-flexible yogis are doing to their bodies and joints. For a long time, flexibility has been my favorite part of my practice and feels the most like celebrating what my body can do. However, after straining my back and hips, I know that pushing my limits is hurting, not helping, my long-term mobility. In theory, I know and accept that I need to focus more on balance, strengthening the stabilizing muscles around my joints, and evening out my core strength. However, none of this feels like a joyful celebration of my body. I'd really appreciate some tips on bringing joy back into my practice while I continue to shift my focus away from flexibility. 

Do you have any favorite videos or instructors that bring the challenge and joy without pushing flexibility? Strong stretchers who emphasize supporting and strengthening joints during mobility moves?

yoga,"Insights on Chakras, Kundalini, and digestion","I'm on a road trip reading the key muscles of yoga in the section on chakras, and I wanted to share an insight I had. 

All of the chakras are associated with digestion (mental and physical), but they play different roles.

Third eye chakra is associated with digestive selection, throat chakra is associated with ingestion, heart chakra is associated with gratitude and acceptance of food, solar plexus is associated with digestive dis-assembly/ fire, sacral chakra is associated with digestive assimilation, and root chakra is associated with digestive excretion. So when Yogis say that drinking water moves kundalini down, I get it now. It literally activates each chakra from the top down. 

Same when we process information. Each chakra gets activated from the top down. So in order to send kundalini up, we need to rest our digestion. Both mental and physical. Otherwise there is a constant downward current. Interestingly, digestion is needed to have any energy at all. So I guess hatha yoga would be about switching between periods of rising kundalini, and descending kundalini. You have to do both. 

I hope this is insightful!",True,2,1637853529,2021-11-25 23:18:49,,,Kuma-shama,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/r1yt0y/insights_on_chakras_kundalini_and_digestion/,1,1.0,insight chakras kundalini digestion road trip read key muscle section chakras want share insight chakras associate digestion mental physical play different role third eye chakra associate digestive selection throat chakra associate ingestion heart chakra associate gratitude acceptance food solar plexus associate digestive disassembly fire sacral chakra associate digestive assimilation root chakra associate digestive excretion yogi say drink water move kundalini literally activate chakra top process information chakra activate top order send kundalini need rest digestion mental physical constant downward current interestingly digestion need energy guess hatha switch period rise kundalini descend kundalini hope insightful,70,32,0,0,5

yoga,Reclined twist - can't keep hips/knees/ankles aligned,"I've been doing yoga on and off for years but I'm basically still a beginner since I've never been too consistent about practicing. Recently I've been following along with a few routines on Youtube and one pose I really struggle with is a reclined twist. It doesn't hurt or anything, and I'm able to keep my shoulders on the ground, but when I twist, my hips naturally splay apart so they aren't at a right angle, and my knees come away from each other so they aren't stacked. One knee ends up in front of the other. Since the teachers always say to make sure the hips and knees and ankles are stacked, I don't know whether I should just continue to do this pose or try to modify or replace it somehow. No matter how I shift my body around, I can never get my hips and knees to stack when my legs are at a right angle. Putting something between my legs doesn't help, either, since if I keep my knees pushing together so that my hips don't splay, I can barely bring my knees down past a 2/10 o'clock angle, and it's uncomfortable to hold this, though maybe this is what I need to do to strengthen my lower back so I can complete the reclined twist?",True,0,1637850558,2021-11-25 22:29:18,,,mozzarella__stick,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/r1xrge/reclined_twist_cant_keep_hipskneesankles_aligned/,1,1.0,recline twist keep hipskneesankles align year basically still beginner never consistent practice recently follow along routine youtube one pose really struggle recline twist doesnt hurt anything able keep shoulder grind twist hip naturally splay apart arent right angle knee come away arent stack one knee end front teacher always say make sure hip knee ankle stack know whether continue pose try modify replace somehow matter shift body around never hip knee stack leg right angle put something leg doesnt help either keep knee push together hip splay barely bring knee past 210 oclock angle uncomfortable hold though maybe need strenhen lower back complete recline twist,104,36,0,0,10

yoga,"Advice When Seeking a Yogic ""Path""","Namaste, all!

I have been practicing for about 10 years now, much more regularly in the past 3 - 5 years, and almost daily this year after a running injury (plantar fasciitis). I practice almost exclusively at home, sometimes with a YouTube practice (Breathe and Flo are my jam), sometimes with music, sometimes silently, usually very slow.

I want to deepen my practice to the point where I can sustainably practice daily with no cues from a video, etc. I want to get and stay strong, challenge myself, and delve deeper into the spiritual practice of yoga. It makes sense to me that the next step would be to get some training in a specific lineage of yoga.

I know there are many schools of yoga, many traditions, etc, but I'm not sure where to begin. In the small amount of research I have done, I've been very interested in Mysore yoga specifically because of its emphasis on a personal practice. But there are no Mysore teachers/classes in Sacramento, CA that I've been able to find.

yoga,What yoga should I do as a beginner and where do I find the material I need?,"I (f24) have recently started to do some yoga. I see som much potential in yoga even though I have just started last week.

I have a small bedroom to practise but I believe as long as I have fun it isn’t much of a hindrance to me. I cannot go to a gum or practice much alongside people as my father is undergoing cancer treatment. He has close to non immune system. So I will have to make due with practicing from home. I also have very little of a social life because of my situation. I even have to study online. 

As mentioned, I see so much potential in yoga for my mental healthy considering my situation. There are so many different forms of yoga, but I don’t know where to start or where to find my material.

yoga,Left Hip Tightness,"I know everyone says each side is different. I feel like my left hip does not stretch no matter what I do. Maybe its not the hip.

I feel Ive made no progress. Maybe small progress but it seems like it always wants to tighten back. I do pigeon, lizard, lunge, hip openers, yogic squats, nothing seems to click. 

It seems like my hip/glute muscle is just so tight. Does anyone have a similar problem? If so how do you deal with it?

yoga,Why yoga is like Legos — every brick matters!,"Happy weekend all! 

Just a quick analogy I hope might help encourage some folks that may be frustrated with not being able to get into those “perfect poses.” 

If an asana is, say, a 1000-piece set (let’s say we’re trying to build a giant Lego mansion) then each brick is like your breath. The goal of any asana is to allow your body to be in balance, to work in perfect alignment as it were. Everything in our beautiful bodies is connected, and they’re not gonna let you add chimneys to places where they’re gonna crumble! Every breath you take with the intention towards building that adds a brick towards your final goal—your “mansion”, the pose. 

You can’t add the window pieces until they have a framework to be placed in, can’t add the chimney until there’s a roof—a foundation is necessary! Trying to just pop into a pose without considering how the entire rest of your life has affected your ability to get into that pose is like trying to build a mansion from thin air! I see my bricks start to “disappear” when I sit poorly at my computer all day (multiple bricks!), get so stressed out I get a headache, try to carry too many groceries home, etc. My past has been filled with “negative brick days,” as it were, where I was tearing down my mansion without realizing it. 

The good thing is—there’s always more bricks to be had! Maybe today one breath opens a little more of your neck, which opens a little more of your shoulder, which opens a more mobility in your arm…

And that’s it! Whether you call them baby steps or Lego bricks—they’re all indispensable pieces of building the mansion/temple/palace you seek to find yourself in. And your creation won’t necessarily look like anyone else’s—there’s all the room in the Universe for expressing *your* perfect place. So if it doesn’t end up looking like that model home, no worries! As long as you build it with all the same safety precautions and necessary “bricks” for it to hold up, that’s just as much a “correct” mansion as anyone else’s! 

So take courage! Take deep breaths! There’s no breath too small (and you can’t lose them like those darn tiny bricks!) and who knows? Maybe you’ll build something bigger than you ever dreamed. 

I hope that encourages anyone that might be feeling a little stuck today. 

I believe in you! You got this! :)",True,1,1637442512,2021-11-21 05:08:32,,,Signal_Drop,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/qyeute/why_yoga_is_like_legos_every_brick_matters/,1,1.0,lego every brick matter happy weekend quick analogy hope might help encourage folk may frustrate able perfect pose asana say 1000piece set let say try build giant lego mansion brick breath goal asana allow body balance work perfect alignment everything beautiful body connect theyre gon na let add chimney place theyre gon na crumble every breath take intention towards build add brick towards final goalyour mansion pose add window piece framework place add chimney roofa foundation necessary try pop pose without consider entire rest life affect ability pose try build mansion thin air see brick start disappear sit poorly computer day multiple brick stress headache try carry many grocery home etc past fill negative brick day tear mansion without realize good thing istheres always brick maybe today one breath open little neck open little shoulder open mobility arm thats whether call baby step lego brickstheyre indispensable piece build mansiontemplepalace seek find creation wont necessarily look anyone elsestheres room universe express perfect place doesnt end look model home worry long build safety precaution necessary brick hold thats much correct mansion anyone el take courage take deep breath breath small lose darn tiny brick know maybe youll build something bigger dream hope encourage anyone might feel little stick today believe,176,38,0,0,7

This was my response that is in a sense a collective response 🤷🏾‍♂️🍀 Tune in 🚀

That’s that FULLMOON energy 🌕 whatever emotions you feed in these NOWs they can explode &amp; if one isn’t a master of the emotional pollution energy world we are living in then things can get wild but also beautiful depending on our surroundings 💆🏾 I‘m happy he is alive 🍀🙏🏾 Sending him some healing frequencies‼️ But yess that’s why I’m on the Animal Mountain most of the time lately 🧘🏾‍♂️ It’s a healing journey or NOT &amp; sometimes old energies find us if we feed the same repetitive unhealthy patterns &amp; that means we gotta be REAAAALLLY careful who we allow into the same space because if people can’t master the shadow consciousness they will fall for the shadow tricks which can happen to us all if we aren’t mindful in every daily decision we take no matter how far we’ve grown! This is the time to walk the healthiest paths on the daily &amp; focus on healing yourself first &amp; everyone around your individual journey or else this system will literally kill you 💆🏾 that’s why I choose to only walk the passionate path &amp; I only allow healthy minded people and nice humans around me so I don’t have to heal their shadow thoughts they may project on me! None of it is real unless we feed it! I choose love, happiness &amp; daily expansions in all the dimensions and I focus on having a solution based thinking in any situation so we can keep thriving &amp; move forward in light &amp; not the darkness which is boring and old news! Shall the humans stop feeding daily stress and focus on daily peace, no more pain only becoming masters of emotions, no more fear they are only lessons, logically speaking all unhealthy emotions that if you feed them daily, they will kill you mentally, physically and via attracting deadly situations like shoot outs, the same fear I passionately let go in an Ayahuasca ceremony in Colombia 🍃 In actuality it’s a collective fear &amp; also a deeply black rooted fear because we sadly glorify that realm daily through music more then anything else hence the reflectional dark happenings 🐼🧠💥🤫 it’s a big loop of energy reactions that can end in death AND it can also end in enlightenment and ascension SO that’s the path I’m choosing in the now 🌞🎄 Love you ALL &amp; stay focused on what got us here!

Breathe‼️ Heal‼️ Create‼️ Mother Nature is holding the space for YOU whenever you are ready to ground &amp; receive abundance 🍀 be mindful with the abundance the universe will send you in every present moment the more you expand within the cosmic love frequencies! Quality connection between EVERY personal human interaction is key! Do the healing work as you enjoy and have fun in this beautiful life we live to the maximum extent! Time is NOW. If you can rewire your daily habits into healthy ones, do spiritual purification processes like cleaning your mind of shadow thoughts by writing out what your thinking until the are healthy, fire healings, breathing practices, stretchings, chantings etc. there is ONLY beauty that comes from the energy you will cultivate with those practices.

yoga,Infinite energy and bliss cannot be harnessed without self-knowledge about 25 internal elements and body-mind perfection through Yoga,"Hello Seekers of truth, yogis and aspiring yogi's,

In this age yoga is misunderstood as an exercise or practice for instant relief from mental and physical ailments that is because high time is spent on material pleasures only, which corrupts mind and body. The right meaning of yoga can only be understood once you take the path of self-realization or the path to seek the truth. Yoga is the lifestyle to seek the truth within over which entire existence is vibrating. True yoga is the separation from nature's modes and establishing your awareness in god consciousness.

[Infinite energy and bliss](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Ha0kgduzXsSSXDnpizoet68DSGA-PSC/view?usp=sharing)

I have written the article above for the seekers of truth, yogic practitioners who know what prana retention and kundalini is and also for seekers who want to look within. This article will give you the knowledge to understand the importance of cultivating sattva guna that is the dire need for today’s unconsciously violent humanity. To gain the fruits of yoga one must drop momentary satisfaction (rajo-tamo guna) and adapt pure sattva.

yoga,Breathe like a cat does when it purrs...,"With your larynx delicately compress, having your chin tucked &amp; your jaw completely relaxed, it is very natural to begin snoring involuntarily; especially for many of us while sleeping.

When this happens at extremes, it is poor for the airway &amp; can even lead to sleep apnea...

HOWEVER...

When this technique is more delicately applied, voluntarily in an upright seated posture (like this good man, [HERE](https://youtu.be/GrWhX1BixBk), is doing – at the 41:40 time stamp, precisely), the effect is that the entire larynx &amp; entry way into the lungs begins to vibrate from the oscillating air pressure, you see.

These vibrations work to greatly promote the absorption of oxygen into the lungs &amp; throughout the body; especially when done as is seen in the video of [this yogi displaying the technique](https://youtu.be/GrWhX1BixBk) for educational purposes.

Please, give it a try!

Move as you see the guy doing in the video, breathing similar to he does as well; like a cat happens to do when it is purring in satisfaction... you see.

There are reasons for these things, as one might imagine...

Think of how it might be true that the wild felines ancestors developed this breathing technique unconsciously in order to promote greater oxygen absorption, for cardiac health &amp; physical endurance! Eureka, why I say, I say!

Follow senpai, take a gander at the [41:40]( https://youtu.be/GrWhX1BixBk) timestamp in the video link...

yoga,Muscular Pain,"i have been doing yoga on and off for nearly eight (8) years now.

During that time i have suffered muscular pain in my pelvic, right middle back, chest, shoulder and more recently my glutes.

Asa baby I broke my left leg as a result the left leg is shorter than the right leg.

I am wondering if such pains are normal in yoga practise, or is due to misalignment of asanas or a mixture of other exercises with yoga such as weights (Dumbells) and stationery biking.

Your valued response would be appreciated.

yoga,Tips for a very tight trapezius.,"Hi all,

I've had chronic pain problems along my whole back for the last ten years. My lower body is much stronger and more stable, but my upper body is consistently getting out of whack. I had some x-rays done and my neck curvature is very straight and I have been suffering from migraines, etc.

I try to do yoga often but I feel like I'm perpetually locked up in the shoulders and neck. It just won't budge. I've been back at manual therapy (trigger point, massage, chiro) for the last few weeks and just trying to stretch a couple days after last week's treatment left me with immense pain along my right trapezius. My therapist did a lot more work yesterday and I'm pretty sore. They told me to take it very easy on the stretching and don't over-do it, but I'm just at a loss. Maybe I'm missing some stretches or poses that might benefit me? I really need to get this back in order. I've rearranged my desk at work to be more posture-friendly and I'm making a point to take many breaks. I am also trying to stop using my phone to browse the internet, etc. Right now just turning my head side-to-side or bending my head forward, I can really feel a deep tightness in the muscles.

yoga,"Men, how has yoga changed your life?","Totally ripping off the last post asking about women (imitation is the sincerest form of flattery!) and not to take away from it, but as a man myself I’m truly curious as to what other guys have experienced.

For me, as someone who admittedly never took yoga as something “dudes do” 5 years ago before I started, I have to say that it indeed changed my life. I’ve always worked out and played sports and was embarrassingly inflexible. My back, knees and shoulders always hurt, I found myself plateauing. But one fateful day, my ex gf suggested we do a class together and to make her happy, I went along. My first class was actually a hot yoga class and I was immediately hooked. The one takeaway I had after my first time was “you think you’re strong…until you do yoga”. I couldn’t believe someone who lifted as much weight as I could, couldn’t even do the most simple poses without shaking uncontrollably. 

5 years later, I’m still going strong and it’s changed my life in more ways than I could ever imagine. For starters, when I do workout with weights, the mind-body-breathing connection I learned from yoga translates into that and my form and control is much better which translates into perfect form, less injury and better results. For conditioning, my stamina has gotten better (again, the breathing) and it complements my workout routine in that it seems to target muscles that I miss at the gym, so I look better than ever. I work at a desk all day, so my posture has always been horrendous and the way I walk has always been off too. But with yoga, people have noticed my posture has been better and same with my walk (my shoes are less worn out). I’ve also gotten a bit taller! (My old license says 180cm but my current one says 182cm). When it comes to sex, it’s a night and day difference (I’ll leave it at that lol). The way I look at life is completely different, I work in a high stress environment and have a lot going on. But being aware of how much tension I hold in my body helps me disperse that negative energy and I don’t hold it in one place as much as I used to. I used to suffer from migraines and I rarely do now.

The list of benefits is endless and I think they’re more pronounced because of the time I got into it. I swear by yoga and I encourage everyone to try it.

yoga,Newbie trying to improve basic vinyasa flow: chair pose is completely impossible unless I bend forward 90 degrees. Is this okay? How do I improve?,"Added a basic vinyasa flow on the advice of my personal trainer to supplement my weight lifting. I've been doing it off and on for six months and while I feel good, a lot of moves are just too hard (i.e. feels mechanically impossible: not ""I'm not strong enough"" or ""I can't stretch that far"").

I'm outrageously tall, have poor balance, and zero hip and ankle mobility.

I could ask a million questions but my big one today is *chair pose.*

Just...*how?*

Once I squat more than 1/4 depth into chair pose I *immediately* collapse onto my butt.

Every.

Single.

Time.

It doesn't *feel* like I'm lacking strength (I know I am in areas). It just feel mechanically impossible. I'd have just as much luck sprouting wings and flying: if you squat and lower your hips and butt into a seating position: how do you catch myself when all 250 lbs of me yank me 7 feet to the ground?

Without anything to catch my fall: how am I suppose to improve? I can't just push/stretch harder and grit through it: I just fail immediately and it feels like there nothing I can do about it.

I can do 1/2 of a chair pose *if* I keep my feet very far apart (a sumo squat: wider than my shoulders) and bend forward 90 degrees (it's the only way to get weight over feet and not behind them: my ankles do not bend forward at all: they just don't. Ever.) So I've just been doing that for six months...and it isn't getting better at all.

yoga,"Yoga with my 9yo for Homeschool, he has more yoga experience than I do, any tips to keep it fun with a mom who cant keep up and is now holding back because she keeps crying?","My son loves yoga so I have incorporated it in our curriculum for homeschooling this year. He has had the opportunity to practice with his father and grandmothers (dad and I are not together but coparent easily enough, the grandmothers are dads mothers, we do not hang out outside of grandchild related activities) So I am here for any advice you are willing to toss in my direction.

On the short fun part but I'd appreciate a variety of ideas: 

how can I keep our imbalanced skill levels fun without him feeling like hes teaching me? Or should it become a class for me that he teaches to nurture this passion of his? It is our health science/PE class so as long as we are moving and learning new things about our bodies his educational needs will be fufilled

On the longer me crying bit:

My lack of core strength has me lightyears behind my son. I've sort of babied my core for too long, between surgeries and injuries I began to move with caution as a habit. 

Well we did our first together exercise last week and I was so proud of how he kindly and gently corrected my warrior II pose, how he lit up when he knew exactly what to do with each pose and the excitement radiating from him was palpable. I however BURST into tears after attempting the candle pose. 

I want to be clear I was not at all upset about not being able to achieve the pose, I am aware this is a process and not something that happens overnight I also think it is important that my son see people not being perfect (we are working on confidence building  skills, he had a rather traumatizing remote learing experience with his dad and grandmothers that left him feeling not smart and shattered the confidence he used to have. We have made great progress) I was crying because I was feeling FEELINGS.  I've been through a few too many traumas, some of which only came to light and memory in the last 5 years. Many I have not been able to process yet. I am in the therapy process but I dont cry very often and when I do it feels empty? This cry was FULL. I had to leave the room because while we discuss emotions openly I was not able to speak and I didn't want him to think it had to do with my inability to complete the pose but I also cannot go into the trauma I have experienced because it is not kid appropriate. He did not know I was crying.

I have been reading that crying is normal, as a relase from the corners of your body and it felt good to get it out but I'm afraid of it deterring an otherwise joyous lesson if I keep having to cry like I'm being gutted every time we make progress. He is so in his element and so sensitive  to others emotions I don't want to ruin his yoga joy.

yoga,I need some good stretches/exercises as i am always sore.,"The past few weeks, I've noticed that I've been in a lot more pain than usual. I constantly feel the need to stretch my arms, back and legs, i always feel uncomfortable, stiff or sore. The biggest issue is that whenever i look down, the back of my neck hurts so much. I slouch, which is bad obviously, but everytime i sit up straight, i get uncomfortable and restless.

I don't really do anything which is entirely my fault. I spend most of my free time playing video games, doing homework or working shifts which all require sitting down and staying still. I play hockey pretty often which always feels good, and i do stretches then but only leg and pelvic stretches for less than a minute on the ice.

I think getting into stretches/yoga (whichever is better) would be very beneficial for my health in multiple ways, especially my neck, back, legs and arms.

But of course, the unknown of the interview looms in the future and I wanted to open up curiosity to other yoga teachers or studio owners. How may a yoga teacher prepare for an interview and what questions are likely to come up? What does a studio look for in a teacher? Any strong ""do nots""?

yoga,Online yoga with pigeon pose in every class?,"My old studio, which is shut down and gone forever, had a preset sequence (which is something I really like, because it leaves so much more room for ""everything else"" - sequence is so distracting to me).

Yoga is about health for me - I manage several chronic conditions with yoga, and my studio (where I had gone twice a week for eight years) was perfect.

The hardest thing about finding a new yoga routine for me is that a class without pigeon pose doesn't work. I need pigeon pose to get the health benefits I need. I have tried throwing a pigeon pose into a class I am already taking that is skipping it, pausing the video, or substituting a pose. It is an awkward solution and ultimately doesn't work. The reason is because a good pigeon pose requires several precursor poses, like the ""ham sandwich"" for example (lizard, half split, pigeon). But the best pigeon pose requires that the whole class build up to it. I found one teacher, Bryan Kest, who seems to offer pigeon pose properly with plenty of precursor poses etc.

yoga,I need a place to vent. I feel alone and am not helping myself,"Firstly, I know this isn’t the best forum to put this on. But I feel like I need to speak to people I aspire more to be like. 

I’m 26. I’m your pretty basic, run of the mill, white guy. For three years I worked in professional sports. I traveled with teams, the whole deal. I left that life. The travel was excruciating. I had to move every 8 months. Pay capped out at $12-15 an hour. I gained a lot of weight (for me) and depression was rampant.

During peak Covid, I was unemployed and alone. I got a 9-5 eventually (still in sports) and I’m in school for data science to transition to more pay in a year and a half. My life feels empty. I feel I’m in an identity crisis. Now that I’m not moving every 8 months for work, it’s apparent how empty my life is and how inauthentic I feel. No likeminded friends. Family far away. I deal with an identity crisis daily. Why do I wear what I wear, do what I do, etc. 

Depression has really been crippling. The lockdowns made me even more apprehensive of “putting myself out there.” I have this vision of who I want to be and it’s the furthest thing from who I am. I play lots of video games to jump into worlds and escape my own reality. My dog’s separation anxiety is a built in excuse to never leave my thin-walled apartment.

I’ve always struggled with my weight. I’m not “fat,” but I’m not thin. I’ve had love handle problems since I was in high school. I routinely tie things around my stomach to hold it in. I hate my body. But I’m inconsistent. I start/stop/start/stop which leads to injury. I just had to sit out a month with a stress fracture scare. It wasn’t yoga - it was CrossFit. I felt I should do CrossFit because it’s more “sporty.” I felt like I didn’t fit in. It didn’t feel like my community. 

The injury scare also was tough. I go hard until I burn out. I’m burnt out. School, work, injuries, depression. Who would I rather be? The opposite. I’d rather be just this completely yogic/meditative person. I want to be loose. I want to be comfortable in my body. I want to have fun. I want to wear more vibrant colors. I want to drop all the sports stuff that I only have because it was this old version of me. There’s this yoga studio near me that does all these events where there’s tons of people. I spoke to the owner over the phone last week and wanted to cry. They do this yoga festival every two months with sound healing, breathwork; a drum circle, dancing. On 12/3 they have a cacao activation night. This Thursday they have a potluck with a DJ. Why can’t I be that? They sounded so fun and lively. But I’m just this cynical, beat up northerner who’s hard nosed as a defense mechanism. I don’t “do” ecstatic dance at events or drum circles or sharing circles. I don’t eat plant-based despite wanting to. I want to completely change what I wear and how I present myself. Why am I in this rut? I just feel alone. 

It’s not just a yoga thing. Or whatever. That’s just an example. It’s everything. I dislike myself. Time is passing. How many days will be in bed? How many nights will I sleep in hoodies or tie ropes around my stomach due to discomfort? And then there’s these people my age who are in great shape, doing cool things with their bodies. Loose and comfortable in their skin. Am I ever going to have this sense of belonging? Is no one ever gonna care about me?

This is all circles and a rant. Each day I do nothing. I know no one in my new town. My depression is so strong I can’t move. People keep fucking telling me to go out and do things. It’s not easy. I have to be stonefaced and strong for people. I don’t have much in life. 4 family members. I need to be a rock. I have to be a constant. Yet I feel hollow. My life’s reaching a point where things once possible now aren’t. I feel fat. I feel empty. I feel there’s no point. Why can’t I transform and become a radically different thing? I don’t even know who I am or who I should be. Im confused. I want to be something special. Average white guy who’s doing grad school and work and tired every day, not leaving bed every day, not feeling okay with myself and no like minded community. Every group around me is a lot older. I want to be around and talk to people my own age. Nobody’s here for me genuinely. I have no guide. I need help to change but I’m all alone. I’m all alone. Sorry for the rant.

yoga,"Y’all, I got plow back!","I’ve had a crap few months. 

My 33 year old husband was struck by a vehicle while cycling with a friend and killed. So lots of bad every day now. 

Then, a few weeks later, I threw out my back, almost the worst I’ve ever done it. I have lumbar scoliosis (~35 degree curvature) and degenerative disc disease (talk about bad genetics. Thanks, Mom. (I don’t know if it’s truly genetic, I’m just being ridiculous, don’t mind me, she did have a bad back though)), so back injuries aren’t uncommon for me. However, infrequent yoga has helped over the last decade. 

After I threw out my back and had to have my 10 year old daughter help me off the floor, I realized I needed to get much more serious about my strength and fitness since I’m now alone. My daughter goes to her dad’s often, and I don’t know if she will be around the next time a laundry basket kicks my ass. 

So, I started doing yoga twice a day. I eased into it, very, very slowly. 

And after just a few weeks of yoga, I’m nearly back to where I was before the injury. It was just over a month recovery time total. 

Anyway, I got a win tonight. Perfect plow pose.

yoga,Thoughts on Teaching Yoga for Low/No Cost?,"Does anyone here teach (or want to teach) yoga with the understanding that they're unlikely to make a full-time career of it? I kinda assumed that was the case for most individuals, but reading some of the conversations lately is making me reconsider that assumption. I'm currently in YTT with the aim to make teaching a supplement to my day job. I don't expect to make a living as a teacher for a few reasons:

* Money is a very real barrier to those who might benefit the most from yoga, and some of us want to teach to those individuals.
* The more people who try a yoga class, the more a person here or there might stick with it and make it part of their everyday life - leading to more studio members, workshop attendees, etc.
* Representation is important, and I'm hoping that people on the fence about trying yoga might be inspired to give it a go if they see someone like themselves.
* I 100% agree that as yoga teachers, we should be life-long students and engaging in continuing education. However, to promote oneself as a yoga teacher has the same level of qualifications from a workshop, a months-long class, or even a well-known but non-accredited program and charge as much as a someone with a graduate degree+ in Physical Therapy, Kinesiology,  Clinical Psychology, etc. doesn't quite link up in my mind? It's one thing to have a professional degree that is supplemented by yoga - or even to make yoga the focus of your practice! - but to claim that they're the same feels disingenuous, especially when someone's insurance might cover the latter and not the former. And 100X fold if you're working with vulnerable communities. **(Note, this is also my discomfort with how Pilates is promoted and how Pilates students are charged.)**

I'd really love to hear your thoughts, so I can see the conversation from multiple sides! Is there space for well-paid, career yoga teachers as well as those of us who aren't as focused on that aspect? Or do you see non-career yoga teachers as drinking their fill + from the well of possible paying students?",True,16,1636497129,2021-11-10 06:32:09,,,AvocadoChiweenie,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/qqf57g/thoughts_on_teaching_yoga_for_lowno_cost/,1,1.0,thought teach lowno cost anyone teach want teach understand theyre unlikely make fulltime career kinda assume case individual read conversation lately make reconsider assumption currently ytt aim make teach supplement day job expect make live teacher reason money real barrier might benefit u want teach individual people try class person might stick make part everyday life lead studio member workshop attendee etc representation important hop people fence try might inspire give go see someone 100 agree teacher lifelong student engage continue education promote oneself teacher level qualification workshop monthslong class even wellknown nonaccredited program charge much someone graduate degree physical therapy kinesiology clinical psychology etc doesnt quite link mind one thing professional degree supplement even make focus practice claim theyre feel disingenuous especially someone insurance might cover latter former 100x fold work vulnerable community note discomfort pilate promote pilate student charge id really love hear thought see conversation multiple side space wellpaid career teacher well u arent focus aspect see noncareer teacher drink fill well possible pay student,173,62,0,0,6
yoga,Similarities Across Poses,"Hey yoga people!!

I've recently gotten back into practice after a couple years of hiatus, and going back to yoga is a new experience every time. I always have been directed by teachers to notice similarities across poses - like how when I lay in child's pose, the verbal cue was to try to lay my rib cage down and over my thighs, trying to press my belly and upper thighs together; this is the same verbal cue given to me for forward fold, as well as in lolasana (connection between thighs and rib cage). 

I really love these similarities across poses, and trying to focus on one has been a fun way to get back into my home practice, so I wanted to ask the group what similarities across poses do you see? What are your favorites? What poses are easy for you to reach that cue (child's pose for me, my torso is completely relaxed on my legs!) while its hard in other poses (I cant yet fully relax my torso on my thighs in forward fold, its such an intense stretch!)?

Id love some direction for other similarities to practice and look for in my practice!

yoga,43 year old with the flexibility of a steel pole - whats the best way to start?,"So I'm a 43 yr old man who hasnt really done much sports in the last decade or so. I've recently lost 2 stone in weight and its made me feel great (still got a stone or two to go), 

I've always had issues with movement and had back and neck pain for a while most likely from my job (truck driver). even simple things like sitting on the floor i start to ache. sitting cross legged normally is a real struggle. i just feel myself having to hold on to my knees just to maintain some balance. 

 I've always wanted to do yoga but there's never been a class or something local. the video's on youtube they all seem to be pro's and i struggle. 

would it be better if i went to a class? i'd feel a bit awkward but i really need to sort myself out get my posture corrected before i'm 50 and i'm making a topic like this on reddit but with more worse circumstances. 

If i was going to go - would knee length shorts and a t-shirt be ok? what kinda yoga mat should i buy??

yoga,It’s time to start placing value in a skilled yoga teacher,"Too often I see people comment on how yoga teachers shouldn’t be paid…

I understand there’s deep seated philosophy and religion used with it…but the way I have been taught and the way I teach yoga is all about the biology, physiology, the neurology…you know?
I want to be able to appeal to everyone with it, not just those who are unthreatened by the idea of yoga. 
I think it’s very important for skilled educators who continue to seek education to join this field. It’s not cheap either! 
Too many people are throwing their bodies in radical poses without proper preparation and proper alignment. Too many people are perpetuating hindering alignments and reinforcing them in their yoga poses.
I strive to forever be the student. I claim no mastery at anything and I fear that this practice, this philosophy, is not shy of people who claim to know it all.
So I ask that we began to put more value on those who truly seek to help people align in their bodies, as this creates a domino affect for the mind and spirit. 


Not to discredit those who have more of an understanding for the philosophical side…my own practice is spiritual. But when it comes to teaching others..I bridge the gap between their understanding and mine. And I, along with everyone else who has dedicated time and money to learn the information, deserve to be paid for our time in teaching the information.",True,35,1636466719,2021-11-09 22:05:19,,,Eeightd,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/qq4e3x/its_time_to_start_placing_value_in_a_skilled_yoga/,1,1.0,time start place value skilled teacher often see people comment teacher shouldnt pay understand deep seat philosophy religion use itbut way teach way teach biology physiology neurologyyou know want able appeal everyone unthreatened idea think important skilled educator continue seek education join field cheap either many people throw body radical pose without proper preparation proper alignment many people perpetuate hinder alignment reinforce pose strive forever student claim mastery anything fear practice philosophy shy people claim know ask begin put value truly seek help people align body create domino affect mind spirit discredit understand philosophical sidemy practice spiritual come teach othersi bridge gap understand mine along everyone dedicate time money learn information deserve pay time teach information,109,22,0,0,11

For a long time I've wanted to start a small resort in the woods near a major city/airport in the US with a focus on Yoga etc.  I'm not too interested in becoming a famous teacher with a following, so renting it to teachers for Yoga Retreats, trainings, etc. seems like a possible solution. 

The finances of starting such a venture aside, could it be successful? Is there enough of a market for retreats (and teachers who want to run them) to make this a thing? What would you want/expect to see in such a place beyond the basics: Quiet natural setting, places to sleep, places to practice, appropriate food.

yoga,So many different Yoga mats which one to choose?,"Hi there Folks,  


I need to buy a Yoga mat that has these requirements:  


* Suitable for the asanas pictured here below.
* Non-toxic material
* Remains grip while sweating. (mirco-fiber would be great) 
* Soft and sticky
* Sturdy (meaning it should last a long time.)
* I will do the asanas mostly at home, so I don't need a mat that is suitable for traveling.

These are the asanas that I'm going to do. I have read that different styles of yoga need specific types of mats. I don't know the exact name or style of these asanas. Maybe some one could enlighten me about which type of style it is? 

Can somebody tell me what type of mat I need to buy?  What is the size of the mat that these asanas require?  And also  what type of terms I need to look for when searching for a yoga mat for my particular needs? For example I saw the terms TPE, PVC, Classic, Pro, Lite ect...    What type of thickness do I need to buy?

yoga,Feeling/being ill day(s) after Yin Yoga,"Hi everyone,

Recently I started picking up Yin Yoga again. I've done this a lot in the past to balance myself a little bit from weight lifting and being really 'yang' all the time. Somehow Yin is always a roller coaster of emotions to me and I feel a lot of release after a session. My heart rate will be a lot lower for hours and I feel very relaxed.   


However, after not having practiced for a while I went to two Yin classes and after both times the days after I felt sick. I remember I had this in the past as well. Could this be of some kind of release? Did anyone else experience this? Will it go away over time? I think Yin is really beneficial to me but to feel sick the day(s) after because of a session is pretty annoying.

yoga,Can anyone recommend more yoga videos like Sara Ivanhoe’s ‘Yoga on the Edge?’,"I really love Sara Ivanhoe’s series, Yoga on the Edge, and I haven’t been able to find anything else like it.

It’s not for beginners but it’s also not pushing you like crazy or doing anything really intense. There’s different length videos so I can do one under 30mins on a lazy day or longer on another. It’s beautiful and serene and calming, really putting me in the right headspace for yoga. The music is great.

If anyone is familiar with the series and can recommend similar videos I’d be very grateful.

yoga,Recommendations for quality yoga clothes and mat in the UK?,"Hello everyone,

I have been practicing daily yoga for around 18 months now. As an anxious and tightly wound person, I love it and am really proud to have forged this new habit in my life.

That said, I would like to treat myself and invest a bit a quality yoga mat and some clothes. Does anyone have any recommendations for these (ideally UK based)? I currently wear some old gym clothes and use an approx. £20 mat from Amazon which is beginning to crumble!
